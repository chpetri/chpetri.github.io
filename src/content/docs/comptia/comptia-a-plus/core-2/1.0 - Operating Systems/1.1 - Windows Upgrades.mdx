### 1.1 - Windows Upgrades

#### Why Upgrade?

- Upgrading keeps files in place, maintaining consistency with customized configurations and multiple local user accounts.
- It saves hours by avoiding application reinstallations, keeping user data intact, and allowing quick resumption of work.

#### Upgrade Methods

- In-place Upgrade: Upgrades the existing OS while keeping all applications, documentation, and settings.
- Clean Install: Involves wiping everything and reloading the OS. It requires backing up files and starting the setup from the installation media.
- Upgrading Windows: Performed from Windows installation media, available for download from Microsoft, including a media creation tool.
- Note: Upgrading from x86 to x64 or vice versa is not possible across all Windows versions. Migration is required instead.

#### Upgrade Paths

- Upgrades often occur between similar or higher-level Windows editions.
- In-place upgrade paths to Windows 10 are available from Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 (but not Windows 8.0).
- In-place upgrade paths to Windows 11 are available from Windows 10.

#### Post-Installation

- Verify if the system works; if it doesn't boot, there are more significant issues.
- Testing can be useful for unknown hardware configurations, accessed via Start > Settings > System > Recovery > Go back.
- Additional installations might include service packs, security patches, security applications, driver updates, and application updates.
