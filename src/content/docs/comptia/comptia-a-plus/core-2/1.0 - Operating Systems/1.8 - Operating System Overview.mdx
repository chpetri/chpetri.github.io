### 1.8 - Operating System Overview

#### Why an OS is Needed

- Controls interaction between components (memory, hard drives, keyboard, CPU).
- Provides a common platform for applications.
- Offers a user interface for human interaction with the machine.

#### Standard OS Features

- File management.
- Application support with memory and swap file management.
- Input and Output support (printers, keyboards, hard drives, USB drives).
- Operating system configuration and management tools.

#### Microsoft Windows

- Has a major market presence with various versions (Windows 10, 11, Server).
- Advantages: Large industry support, broad selection of OS options, extensive software support.
- Disadvantages: Target for security exploitation, integration challenges due to broad hardware support.

#### Linux

- A free Unix-compatible software system.
- Numerous distributions available (Ubuntu, Debian, Red Hat/Fedora).
- Advantages: Cost-effective, works on a wide variety of hardware, active user community.
- Disadvantages: Limited driver support, especially for laptops, limited support options.

#### Apple macOS

- Desktop OS for Apple hardware.
- Advantages: User-friendly, highly compatible, fewer security concerns.
- Disadvantages: Restricted to Apple hardware, less industry support than PC platform, higher initial hardware cost.

#### Chrome OS

- Googleâ€™s operating system based on the Linux kernel.
- Centered around the Chrome web browser, with most apps being web-based.
- Available from various manufacturers, generally less expensive.
- Reliant on cloud connectivity.

#### Apple iPadOS

- Operating system for Apple's iPads, a variant of iOS.
- Features desktop browser (Safari), second monitor support (Sidecar), keyboard support, multitasking.

#### Apple iOS

- For Apple iPhones, based on Unix.
- Closed-source, exclusive to Apple products.
- Apps developed with iOS SDK on macOS, must be approved by Apple, available in the Apple App Store.

#### Google Android

- Supported on various manufacturers' devices.
- Open-source OS based on Linux.
- Apps developed on Windows, macOS, Linux with the Android SDK, available from Google Play and third-party sites.

#### Vendor-specific Limitations

- End-of-life policies vary by company.
- OSes check and prompt for updates; Chrome OS updates automatically.
- Some content can be shared across operating systems, but direct application compatibility is limited.
- Web-based apps offer cross-platform potential.

#### File Systems

- Before data can be written to a partition, it must be formatted (FAT32, NTFS, exFAT, etc.).
- Operating systems expect data in a specific format.
- Many OSes can read (and sometimes write) multiple file system types.

#### FAT File System

- One of the first PC-based file systems.
- FAT32 supports larger volume sizes and a maximum file size of 4 gigabytes.
- exFAT, designed for flash drives, supports larger files and is compatible across many OSes.

#### NTFS

- NT File System offers extensive improvements over FAT32 (quotas, file compression, encryption, etc.).
- Limited compatibility across operating systems; many can read but not write to NTFS.

#### Other

File Systems

- ext3 and ext4 commonly used by Linux OS.
- APFS (Apple File System) optimized for solid-state storage, included with macOS High Sierra and later, as well as iOS and iPadOS.
