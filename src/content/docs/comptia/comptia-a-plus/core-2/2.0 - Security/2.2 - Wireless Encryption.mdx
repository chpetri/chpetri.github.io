### 2.2 - Wireless Encryption

#### Securing a Wireless Network

- Wireless networks can contain confidential information, necessitating controlled access through authentication (usernames, passwords, multi-factor authentication).
- Communication must be confidential and maintain integrity, hence the need for encryption and message integrity checks (MIC).

#### WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access)

- WPA, introduced in 2002, replaced WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) due to its cryptographic weaknesses.
- It uses RC4 with TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), featuring a larger Initialization Vector (IV) and an encrypted hash, providing each packet with a unique 128-bit encryption key.

#### Wireless Encryption

- Encryption is critical as wireless communications can be intercepted.
- WPA2 and WPA3 are standards in wireless encryption.

#### WPA2 and CCMP

- WPA2, certified in 2004, uses the CCMP block cipher mode.
- CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) offers data confidentiality with AES encryption and a Message Integrity Check (MIC) with CBC-MAC.

#### WPA3 and GCMP

- Introduced in 2018, WPA3 uses GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol), a stronger encryption than WPA2.
- GCMP ensures data confidentiality with AES and includes a MIC with Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC).

#### The WPA2 PSK Problem

- WPA2 has a vulnerability to brute-force attacks on the Pre-Shared Key (PSK), especially if a weak PSK is used.
- Once the PSK is compromised, attackers gain access to the wireless network.

#### SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals)

- WPA3's SAE process includes mutual authentication, creating a shared session key without transmitting it across the network.
- It prevents brute-force attacks and adds perfect forward secrecy.

#### Wireless Security Modes

- Wireless routers offer various security modes, including Open System (no authentication), WPA/2/3-Personal (with a shared key), and WPA/2/3-Enterprise (individual authentication via an authentication server).

### 2.2 - Authentication Methods

#### RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)

- A common AAA protocol used for centralized authentication across various platforms and devices.
- RADIUS servers manage authentication for routers, servers, VPN access, and 802.1X network access.

#### TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System)

- A remote authentication protocol developed for ARPANET access control.
- TACACS+ is the latest version, offering more authentication requests and response codes.

#### Kerberos

- A network authentication protocol allowing for mutual authentication and protection against on-path or replay attacks.
- It has been a standard since the 1980s and is used in various operating systems, including Microsoft Windows.

#### SSO with Kerberos

- Single Sign-On (SSO) with Kerberos allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple resources.
- It streamlines the login process but is limited to Kerberos-compatible systems.

#### Which Method to Use?

- The choice of authentication method depends on available resources and requirements.
- RADIUS is common for VPN concentrators, TACACS+ for Cisco devices, and Kerberos for Microsoft networks.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

- Multi-factor authentication involves multiple verification methods.
- It can range from expensive (hardware tokens) to inexpensive (smartphone applications).
