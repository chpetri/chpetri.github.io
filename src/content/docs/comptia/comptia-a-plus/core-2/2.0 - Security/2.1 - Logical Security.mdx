### 2.1 - Logical Security

#### Least Privilege

- Rights and permissions set to the minimum necessary level.
- Limits the scope of potential malicious behavior.
- Users and applications operate with minimal privileges, avoiding administrative rights.

#### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- Used for controlling network traffic, also applicable in operating systems.
- ACLs based on criteria like IP addresses, TCP/UDP port numbers, ICMP.
- Function to allow or deny access to file systems.

#### Multi-factor Authentication

- Involves multiple verification factors like something you know, have, or are.
- Includes software tokens, SMS, voice calls, and more.
- Enhances security but can be more costly.

#### Software Tokens

- Authenticator applications generating pseudo-random numbers.
- Free smartphone applications replacing separate physical devices.
- SMS and voice call options for token delivery, though they have security considerations.

#### Email Filtering

- Filters unsolicited emails at the gateway.
- Scans for and blocks malware, phishing attempts, and other unwanted content.

### 2.1 - Active Directory

#### Active Directory

- A network database including computers, user accounts, printers, groups, etc.
- Manages authentication and centralized access control.
- Frequently used by help desks for password resets and account management.

#### Domain

- A collection of networked users, computers, and resources.
- Managed by domain controllers using Active Directory.
- Key in troubleshooting network issues.

#### Organizational Units (OUs)

- Structure for organizing the Active Directory database.
- Can be tailored to specific groups or regions.
- Policies can be applied to OUs, affecting a large or specific set of users.

#### Login Script

- Automates tasks during user login.
- Associated with Group Policy for specific users, groups, or OUs.
- Allows for customization based on specific needs.

#### Group Policy/Updates

- Centralized management of computers and users.
- Includes settings for network configurations, security parameters, and login scripts.
- Group Policy Management Editor for setting policies.

#### Home Folder

- Network folder assigned to a user for managing and backing up files.
- Automatically created directories with appropriate permissions.
- Requires user training for effective use.

#### Folder Redirection

- Redirects standard Windows Library folders to network shares.
- Managed via Group Policy.
- Often used alongside Offline Files feature for access when disconnected.

#### Security Groups

- Groups with assigned permissions.
- Users added to groups inherit the group's rights and permissions.
- Built-in groups for different roles and functions, simplifying management.

#### Group Policy and Login Scripts

- Group Policy used to enforce network-wide settings and configurations.
- Login scripts for automating user-specific tasks at login.
- Essential for maintaining network security and user efficiency.
