**Change Management**

- **Change control**
  - A formal process to ensure that the change is made in a controlled manner and that the change is implemented in a timely manner.
  - Avoid Downtime, confusion and disruption due a standardized change process.
  - Mostly well defined in corporate policies and procedures.
- **Nothing changes without this plan**
  - Planning is a key part of change management.
  - Estimate the impact and risks of the change and plan for the necessary resources.
  - If something goes wrong, have a recovery plan in place.
  - **TEST** before final deployment.
  - Document the change process and procedures.
  - Make the change

**Troubleshooting Process Best Practices**

**The best way to troubleshoot is to follow a structured approach.** When troubleshooting, it's crucial to follow a structured approach. Here’s an optimized troubleshooting process presented as an ordered list with subpoints, including best practices

1. **Identify the Problem**

     - Verify if the issue can be replicated.
     - Check system logs and error messages.
   - **Backup:**
     - Ensure data is backed up before making system changes.
   - **Environmental Checks:**
     - Look for recent environmental changes (e.g., power outages, moved equipment).
2. **Establish a Theory of Probable Cause**
   - **Question the Obvious:**
     - Don't overlook simple solutions (e.g., is the device plugged in?).
   - **Research:**
     - Utilize internal knowledge bases or external sources to understand symptoms.
3. **Test the Theory to Determine the Cause**
   - **Confirm the Theory:**
     - Conduct tests to confirm if the cause is identified correctly.
   - **Reassess:**
     - If the initial theory is incorrect, develop a new one.
     - Consider escalating if the issue is beyond your expertise.
4. **Establish a Plan of Action to Resolve the Problem and Implement the Solution**
   - **Vendor's Instructions:**
     - Follow any guidelines provided by the hardware or software vendors.
   - **Action Steps:**
     - Outline detailed steps for the resolution plan.
5. **Verify Full System Functionality**
