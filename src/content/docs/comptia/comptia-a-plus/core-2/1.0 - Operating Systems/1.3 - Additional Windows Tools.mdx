### 1.3 - Additional Windows Tools

#### System Information

- Provides an overview of the system through `msinfo32.exe`.
- Details hardware resources like memory, DMA, IRQs, and conflicts.
- Shows components including multimedia, display, input, and network.
- Outlines the software environment, including drivers, print jobs, and running tasks.

#### Resource Monitor

- Offers a detailed real-time view of performance, categorized by:
  - Overview, CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network.
- Accessible through `resmon.exe`.

#### System Configuration

- A comprehensive tool for system management via `msconfig.exe`.

#### Disk Cleanup

- Identifies unused or unnecessary files, helping to free up space.
- Select categories to clean and click the button.
- Accessed through `cleanmgr.exe`.

#### Defragmentation (`defrag`)

- Defragments a disk to improve read and write times by making file fragments contiguous.
- Not necessary for solid-state drives (SSDs) as Windows doesn't defrag SSDs.
- Has a graphical version in the drive properties.
- Requires elevated permissions. Command line usage: `defrag <volume>`, e.g., `defrag C:`.

#### Registry Editor (`regedit.exe`)

- A critical tool for accessing the Windows Registry, a comprehensive database used by almost all system components.
- Caution is advised; always back up the registry before making changes.

```powershell
# Registry keys are organized into a hierarchical structure, similar to a file system.
- The registry is organized into five root keys:
  - HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT (HKCR)
  - HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKCU)
  - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM)
  - HKEY_USERS (HKU)
  - HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC)
```
