### 2.4 - Social Engineering

Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into performing actions or divulging confidential information. It's a significant security threat as it often involves exploiting human psychology rather than technical hacking techniques.

#### Key Concepts in Social Engineering

- **Effective Social Engineering**: Constantly evolving tactics involving multiple people and organizations, can occur in person or electronically.
- **Phishing**: A common social engineering technique, often via email or text, that tricks recipients into divulging sensitive information.
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing conducted over phone calls or voicemail, using caller ID spoofing and fake security checks.
- **Shoulder Surfing**: Observing someone's private information over their shoulder, common in public places like airports, coffee shops, and offices.

#### Preventing Social Engineering

- **Anti-Phishing Training**: Educating users not to share private information and recognize phishing attempts.
- **End User Education**: Involves personal training, visible reminders (posters, signs), and online resources.
- **OS Reinstallation**: A guaranteed way to remove malware, involving wiping everything and starting from scratch.

#### Specific Social Engineering Techniques

- **Spear Phishing and Whaling**: Targeted phishing attacks using inside information, often directed at high-level executives.
- **Tailgating and Piggybacking**: Gaining unauthorized access to restricted areas by following authorized personnel.
- **Impersonation**: Pretending to be someone else, like a help desk employee, to gain access to sensitive information.
- **Dumpster Diving**: Searching through trash for sensitive information.
- **Wireless Evil Twins**: Setting up malicious Wi-Fi access points that mimic legitimate ones to intercept data.

### 2.4 - Denial of Service (DoS) and Zero-Day Attacks

#### Denial of Service (DoS)

- **DoS Attack**: Overloading a service or exploiting a vulnerability to make a system unavailable.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**: Uses a network of compromised computers (botnets) to launch a coordinated attack.
- **Mitigating DDoS Attacks**: Can involve filtering traffic patterns, ISP interventions, and third-party technologies.

#### Zero-Day Attacks

- **Zero-Day Vulnerability**: A flaw in software that's exploited before developers have a chance to create a fix.
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Increasingly common, these take advantage of yet-to-be-detected or published vulnerabilities.

### 2.4 - On-Path Attacks and Password Security

#### On-Path Network Attack (Formerly Man-in-the-Middle)

- **On-Path Attack**: Intercepts and redirects traffic without the victim's knowledge.
- **ARP Poisoning**: A common local network on-path attack exploiting the Address Resolution Protocol.

#### Password Security

- **Plain Text/Unencrypted Passwords**: Storing passwords without encryption, a risky and discouraged practice.
- **Hashing Passwords**: Representing data as fixed-length strings for secure storage.
- **Brute Force and Dictionary Attacks**: Methods for cracking passwords by trying every possible combination or using common words.

### Key Takeaways

- Social engineering exploits human vulnerabilities rather than technical flaws.
- Denial of Service attacks aim to make resources unavailable.
- Zero-Day exploits target undiscovered vulnerabilities.
- On-path attacks intercept data in transit.
- Strong password practices, including hashing and avoiding plain text storage, are crucial for security.
