### 1.2 - Windows Command Line Tools

#### Privileges

- Not every user can execute all commands; some are reserved for administrators.
- Standard privileges allow running applications as a normal user, suitable for many commands.
- Administrative or elevated privileges require membership in the Administrators group. To run a command with these privileges, right-click the Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' or use 'cmd' with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.

#### Command Line Troubleshooting

- Use the “help” command if unsure about a command's function. For example:
  - `> help dir`
  - `> help chkdsk`
- For specific command help, use `[command] /?`
- To exit the command prompt, type `exit`.

#### File Management

```powershell
> dir
> cd [directory]
> cd ..
> md [directory]
> rd [directory]
```

- `dir`: Lists files and directories.
- `cd` / `chdir`: Changes the working directory. Use a backslash `\` to specify a volume or folder name.
- `..`: Represents the folder above the current folder.
- `md` / `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
- `rd` / `rmdir`: Removes a directory.

#### Drive Letters

- Each partition is assigned a letter, with the primary storage drive usually being C.
- Reference a drive with its letter followed by a colon (e.g., `C:`).
- Combine this with the folder path, separating folder names with backslashes (e.g., `C:\Users\professor`).

#### Hostname

- Use `hostname` to view the device's name. This is especially useful when working with multiple terminal screen tabs.
- The Windows device name can be changed in the System settings.

#### Format

- The `format` command formats a disk for use with Windows (e.g., `format c:`).

```powershell
# better dont do this
> format c:
```

#### Copy (/v, /y)

```powershell
> copy [source] [destination]
> copy /v [source] [destination]
> copy /y [source] [destination]
```

#### xcopy (/s, /e, /v, /y)

```powershell
> xcopy [source] [destination]
> xcopy /s [source] [destination]
> xcopy /e [source] [destination]
> xcopy /v [source] [destination]
> xcopy /y [source] [destination]
```

-     Copies files and directory trees, e.g., xcopy /s Documents m:\backups.

#### Robocopy (/s, /e, /v, /y)

```powershell
> robocopy [source] [destination]
> robocopy /s [source] [destination]
> robocopy /e [source] [destination]
> robocopy /v [source] [destination]
> robocopy /y [source] [destination]
```

- Robust file copy, e.g., robocopy /s Documents m:\backups.
