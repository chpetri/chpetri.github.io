### 1.7 - Installing Applications

#### Compatibility

- A 32-bit OS cannot run 64-bit apps, but a 64-bit OS can run 32-bit apps.
- In a 64-bit Windows OS, 32-bit apps are installed in \Program Files (x86), and 64-bit apps in \Program Files.

#### Graphics Requirements

- Integrated graphics combine CPU and GPU on the same chip, using system memory for graphics, commonly found in laptops.
- Dedicated graphics cards have their own VRAM, required for high-end graphics needs.
- Check application requirements for integrated or dedicated graphics and VRAM.

#### RAM Requirements

- RAM is crucial for application performance.
- Requirements vary depending on the application and must be considered along with other running applications.

#### CPU Requirements

- CPU processing speed, usually measured in gigahertz (GHz), is a broad measurement of performance.
- Application requirements vary widely, from word processing to video editing.

#### External Hardware Tokens

- Used to manage application usage, limiting access to authorized users.
- Applications only operate with the hardware token connected, typically a USB device.
- Commonly used with high-end software due to high per-seat licensing costs.

#### Storage Requirements

- Initial installation space and subsequent usage vary.
- Some applications use a significant amount of storage after installation.

#### Distribution Methods

- Physical media like optical media, USB drives (increasingly rare).
- Downloadable software directly from the manufacturer or centralized app stores.
- ISO files represent sector-by-sector copies of data on optical discs and are mounted in the OS.

#### Installation Considerations

- Installing applications should be done carefully, as they have the same rights as the user.
- Potential impacts include application upgrades stopping working, slowdowns, deleted files, access to internal services, and effects on network and operation.
