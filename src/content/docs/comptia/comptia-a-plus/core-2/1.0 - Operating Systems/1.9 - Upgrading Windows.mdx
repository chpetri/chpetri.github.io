### 1.9 - Upgrading Windows

#### Why Upgrade?

- **Upgrade vs. Install:** Upgrading keeps files and settings in place, while a fresh install starts anew.
- Upgrades maintain consistency, save time, and keep user data and settings intact.

#### Upgrade Methods

- **In-Place Upgrade:** Upgrades the existing OS, retaining applications, documents, and settings.
- **Clean Install:** Wipes everything and reloads the OS, necessitating a backup of files.

#### Preparing the Boot Drive

- Understand the current state of the drive (data, format, partitions).
- Backup any old data.
- Most partitioning and formatting can be completed during installation.

#### Before Installation

- Check minimum and recommended OS requirements.
- Run a hardware compatibility check.
- Prepare for installation questions (drive/partition configuration, license keys).
- Assess application and driver compatibility.

#### Windows Product Lifecycle

- Regular quality and feature updates.
- Support provided after release, duration depends on the Windows version and edition.
- Known as the Modern Lifecycle Policy for continuously supported products.
