### 1.9 - Installing Operating Systems

#### Boot Methods

- **USB Storage:** Requires a bootable USB and computer support for USB booting.
- **Optical Media:** CD-ROM and DVD-ROM are options.
- **PXE (Preboot Execution Environment):** Allows remote network installation if supported by the computer.
- **Solid State Drives / Hard Drives:** Can store multiple OS installation files.
- **Internet-Based:** Used for Linux distributions, macOS Recovery installation, Windows updates.
- **External / Hot Swappable Drive:** Some external drives can mount an ISO image and boot from USB.
- **Internal Hard Drive:** Install and boot from a separate drive or create and boot from a new partition.

#### Types of Installations

- **In-Place Upgrade:** Maintains existing applications and data.
- **Recovery Partition:** Hidden partition with installation files.
- **Clean Install:** Wipes the slate clean for reinstallation; migration tools can assist.
- **Image Deployment:** Deploys a clone to every computer, quick and can be automated.
- **Repair Installation:** Fixes issues with the Windows OS without modifying user files.
- **Remote Network Installation:** Utilizes a local server or shared drive, installs across the internet.
- **Load Alternative Third-Party Drivers:** Necessary for disk controller drivers, etc.
- **Disk Partitioning:** Divides the physical drive into logical pieces, useful for separating operating systems.

#### GPT Partition Style

- **GPT (GUID Partition Table):** Latest partition format standard.
- Requires UEFI BIOS.
- Supports up to 128 partitions.
- Maximum partition size significantly exceeds traditional limits.

#### MBR Partition Style

- **MBR (Master Boot Record):** Older standard with limitations.
- Maximum of four primary partitions per hard disk.
- Extended partitions contain additional logical partitions, which are not bootable.

#### Disk Partitioning

- First step in preparing disks.
- An MBR-style hard disk supports up to four partitions.
- GUID partition tables support up to 128 partitions with UEFI BIOS.
- Caution advised due to potential for data loss.

#### Quick Format vs. Full Format

- **Quick Format:** Creates a new file table, appearing as if data is erased without additional checks.
- **Full Format:** Writes zeros to the entire disk, making data unrecoverable and checks for bad sectors.
