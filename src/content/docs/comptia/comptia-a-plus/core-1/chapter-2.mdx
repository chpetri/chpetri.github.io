### 2.1 Common Network Ports

---

**TCP and UDP**

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are methods of transporting data over the internet, both encapsulated within the IP (Internet Protocol):

- **OSI Layer 4:** Known as the transport layer.
- **Multiplexing:** Allows the use of multiple applications simultaneously using TCP and UDP.
- **A Series of Moving Vans**
  - The data transport across a network can be likened to a fleet of moving vans.
  - The network topology represents the road system (Ethernet, DSL, cable).
  - IP is the truck designed for these roads, carrying boxes of data (TCP and UDP).
  - The boxes contain the actual application data that needs to be transported.

**Client-Server Model**

**In the client-server model**, data is packaged and sent through a series of headers and trailers that encapsulate different types of protocols:

- **Ethernet Frame:** Consists of an Ethernet header, payload (which could be an IP packet), and trailer.
- **IP Packet**: Encapsulated within the Ethernet frame, carrying TCP or UDP packets.
- **TCP/UDP Packet**: Contains the payload with actual data, like HTTP data for web traffic.

**TCP - Transmission Control Protocol Communication**

**TCP** is known for:

- **Connection-Oriented**: It establishes a formal connection before data transfer and closes it afterward.
- **Reliability**: It can recover from errors and manage out-of-order messages or retransmissions.
- **Flow Control**: The receiver can control the flow of data to prevent overload.

**UDP - User Datagram Protocol Communication**

On the other Hand **UDP** is:

- **Connectionless**: It does not establish a formal connection before data transfers.
- **Unreliable Delivery**: There is no error recovery or data reordering.
- **no Flow Control:** The sender has full control over the amount of data transmitted, regardless of the receiver's state.

### 2.1 Introduction to IP (continued)

**Why Use UDP?**

Using UDP (User Datagram Protocol) might be favorable in scenarios where:

- **Real-time communication** is essential, and there's no time for retransmissions (like live audio or video streaming).
- **Connectionless protocols** such as DHCP for network configuration or TFTP for simple file transfers are involved.

**Communication Using TCP**

**TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) is chosen for:

- **Connection-oriented protocols** that require a "return receipt," like HTTPS for secure web browsing or SSH for secure command-line interface access.
- **Error and Order Handling:** Applications don't need to worry about data sequence or loss — TCP takes care of that.

**Speedy Delivery**

- **IP Addresses:** Just as homes have addresses, so do computers in the form of IP addresses.
- **Port Numbers:** Each data packet (box) has a "room" where it's supposed to go, indicated by a port number on the packet.

**Lots of Ports**

- **IPv4 Sockets:** Combinations of IP addresses, protocols, and port numbers for both server and client.
- **Non-ephemeral Ports:** Permanent ports ranging from 0 to 1023, typically on servers.
- **Ephemeral Ports:** Temporary ports ranging from _1024 to 65535_, assigned in real-time by the client.

**Port Numbers**

- **Range:** Any number between 0 and 65535.
- **Server Use:** Most services use non-ephemeral (permanent) port numbers, although this is not a strict rule.
- **Security:** Port numbers are not a security measure but a method of directing traffic.
- **Well-known Ports:** Essential for services to communicate properly; different for TCP and UDP.

### 2.1 Common Network Ports (continued)

**Port Numbers and Protocols**

- **Well-known Port Numbers:** Required for matching client and server applications and important for configuring firewall rules.

### 2.2 Network Devices

**Network Devices Overview**

Network devices serve a variety of roles in creating and maintaining communication systems. Some devices may have combined functions like a wireless router that acts as a switch and firewall. Knowing when to use each type is crucial for an efficient network.

**Routers**

- Direct traffic between IP subnets based on IP addresses.
- Often connect different network types (e.g., LAN, WAN) and mediums (e.g., copper, fiber).
- Integrated routers in switches are known as “layer 3 switches.”

**Switches**

- Perform fast bridging in hardware, using ASICs, and forward traffic based on data link (MAC) addresses.
- Provide many ports and features, including PoE, and form the core of an enterprise network.
- Multilayer switches also include routing functions.

**Unmanaged Switches**

- Offer minimal configurations and are generally plug-and-play.
- They are fixed and simple, not supporting VLANs or management protocols, and are usually less expensive.

**Managed Switches**

- Support VLANs, traffic prioritization, redundancy protocols like STP, and port mirroring.
- Allow for external management via SNMP.

**Access Points**

- Bridges that extend a wired network to wireless networks.
- Forward based on MAC addresses.
- A wireless router combines a router and access point in one device.

**Patch Panels**

- Combine punch-down blocks and RJ-45 connectors.
- Enable permanent cable runs to desks and flexible connections from the panel to switches.

**Firewalls**

- Filter traffic by port number and sometimes by application.
- Capable of encrypting traffic and acting as proxies.
- Situated at the network’s ingress/egress points, many also function as layer 3 devices.

**Power over Ethernet (PoE)**

**PoE Technologies**

- Deliver power along with network connectivity over Ethernet cables, beneficial for devices like phones and cameras.
- Power may come directly from switches (Endspans) or through in-line power injectors (Midspans).

### 2.2 Software Defined Networking

**Introduction to SDN**

**Software Defined Networking (SDN)** separates networking functions into different layers for enhanced management and adaptability, particularly in cloud environments.

**SDN Layers**

- **Infrastructure/Data Plane**: Handles the processing and forwarding of frames and packets.
- **Control Layer/Control Plane**: Manages the data plane's actions, like updating routing tables.
- **Application Layer/Management Plane**: Deals with the configuration and management of devices using SSH, browsers, or APIs.

**SDN Data Flows**

SDN's layered approach facilitates extended physical architecture, allowing for greater control and flexibility of network resources and services.

### 2.3 - Wireless Network Standards

**Wireless Standards**

Wireless networking is generally referred to by the 802.11 standard, which is governed by the IEEE LAN/MAN Standards Committee, also known as IEEE 802. Over time, various updates to this standard have been released, so it's recommended to check with the IEEE for the most current versions. The "Wi-Fi" name you commonly see is actually a trademark, and the Wi-Fi Alliance is responsible for testing to ensure different wireless devices can work together smoothly.

**802.11a**

Introduced in October 1999, the 802.11a standard was one of the initial forms of wireless networking, operating in the 5 GHz frequency. It could reach speeds up to 54 Mbit/s but had a shorter range compared to the later 802.11b due to higher frequency signals being more easily absorbed by obstacles. Nowadays, it's rare to encounter 802.11a in use.

**802.11b**

Also from October 1999, 802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz band, offering speeds up to 11 Mbit/s. It enjoys a better range than 802.11a since its lower frequency experiences less absorption by objects. However, the 2.4 GHz band is quite busy, leading to potential interference from various household devices like baby monitors and microwaves, as well as technologies like Bluetooth. This standard is also less commonly in use today.

**802.11g**

As an upgrade to 802.11b, 802.11g was released in June 2003 and operated at 2.4 GHz, offering enhanced speeds up to 54 Mbit/s—matching 802.11a—and was backwards compatible with 802.11b. However, it faced the same congestion issues as 802.11b due to the crowded 2.4 GHz band.

**802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)**

In October 2009, 802.11n (or Wi-Fi 4) arrived as a significant improvement over previous standards. It could use both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands, supporting up to 600 Mbit/s with the use of 40 MHz channels and four antennas. A key technology introduced with 802.11n is MIMO (Multiple-input multiple-output), allowing the use of multiple antennas for both transmission and reception, improving speed and range.

**802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)**

Approved in January 2014, 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) marked a substantial leap forward from 802.11n. Operating exclusively on the less congested 5 GHz band and using wider channels (up to 160 MHz), it allowed for denser signal modulation, which translates into faster data transfer rates. With support for eight downlink MU-MIMO streams, Wi-Fi 5 could handle nearly 7 gigabits per second—doubling the number of streams compared to Wi-Fi 4.

**802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**

The latest standard as of February 2021, 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), builds upon 802.11ac, operating on both 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies. Despite offering a modest increase in per-channel throughput to 1,201 Mbit/s, it adds eight bi-directional MU-MIMO streams and introduces OFDMA (Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access), a technology that enhances performance in crowded environments by operating similarly to cellular networks.

**Long-Range Fixed Wireless**

When attempting long-range wireless connections, such as between two buildings miles apart, using fixed directional antennas and increasing signal strength can be essential. Outdoor environments tend to minimize signal bounce and absorption. However, wireless regulations can be intricate and vary by country, affecting factors like frequency use and signal strength. Engaging an expert for outdoor antenna installations is always recommended for safety and compliance.

**RFID (Radio-frequency identification)**

RFID technology is pervasive, found in various applications from access badges to pet identification. It uses radio energy to activate and read information from tags, which can either be passive (powered by the reader's signal) or active (self-powered).

**NFC (Near Field Communication) - 13.56 MHz**

An advancement from RFID, NFC supports two-way wireless communication over short distances. It's commonly used in payment systems and as a method for initiating connections with other wireless technologies, like Bluetooth.

**Wireless Network Technologies**

The 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz spectra for 802.11 technologies in North America have designated channels, ranging from 36 to 165 for 5 GHz and 1, 6, and 11 for 2.4 GHz, each with their own MHz bandwidth considerations. New channels are sometimes added, and usage of these frequencies is governed by specific regulations in most countries, which manage aspects like spectrum use and power output.

**Bluetooth - 2.4 GHz**

Bluetooth eliminates the need for wires in devices like headsets and keyboards. Operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, it shares this frequency with other technologies, including Wi-Fi. Consumer Bluetooth devices typically have a range of about 10 meters, while industrial versions may reach over 100 meters.

### 2.5 - IPv4 and IPv6 (continued)

**Turning Dynamic into Static IP Addresses**

- DHCP normally allocates IP addresses dynamically from a pool.
- To keep an IP address static (unchanged), you have two options:
  - Disable DHCP on the device and set the IP details manually, which needs more management.
  - Preferably, create a DHCP reservation to bind a specific IP address to a device's MAC address.

**Avoiding Manual Configurations**

- Manually configuring IP addresses is less flexible and harder to manage.
- DHCP reservations are the preferred method because changes can be centrally managed from the DHCP server.

**Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)**

- APIPA provides automatic IP assignment in the range of 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255 when DHCP fails.
- It's only for local communications as routers do not forward APIPA addresses.

**DHCP Overview**

- Before DHCP, IP configurations were manual, including setting the IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS.
- The predecessor to DHCP was BOOTP, which required some manual configuration and had limitations in managing IP address allocations.
- DHCP, released in 1997, streamlined the process by fully automating IP address configuration for network devices.

**The DHCP Process (DORA)**

- **Discover**: The client broadcasts a message to locate available DHCP servers.
- **Offer**: DHCP servers respond with available IP address options.
- **Request**: The client requests a specific IP address from one of the offers.
- **Acknowledgment**: The DHCP server acknowledges the request and assigns the IP address to the client.
