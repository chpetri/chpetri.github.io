### 1.6 - Configuring Windows Firewall

#### Windows Defender Firewall

- The firewall should always be enabled, though it may be temporarily disabled for troubleshooting.
- Can be turned on or off from the main screen, requiring elevated permissions.
- Different settings are available for each network type (Public/Private).

#### Windows Firewall Configuration

- Option to block all incoming connections, which ignores any exception list.
- Useful for maximum security needs.
- Modify notifications for app blocking.

#### Creating a Firewall Exception

- Allows specific apps or features through Windows Firewall.
- Configure port numbers to block or allow.
- Predefined exceptions list common applications.
- Create custom rules for detailed firewall control.

#### How Windows Gets an IP Address

- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) for automatic IP addressing.
- APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) assigns a link-local address when no static address or DHCP server is available.
- Static address configuration requires manual input of specific details.

#### TCP/IP Host Addresses

- IP Address: Unique identifier.
- Subnet Mask: Identifies the subnet.
- Gateway: Route off the subnet to the rest of the world.
- DNS (Domain Name Services): Converts domain names to IP addresses.
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol): Automates the IP address configuration process.
- Addresses can be dynamic or static.
- Loopback address (127.0.0.1) is always available.
- Multiple DHCP servers can be configured for redundancy.
- If a DHCP server is not available, Windows uses an Alternative Configuration, defaulting to APIPA addressing, or a static IP address can be configured.
