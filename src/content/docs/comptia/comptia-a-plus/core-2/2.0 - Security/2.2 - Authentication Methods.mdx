### 2.2 - Authentication Methods

#### RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service)

- A common AAA protocol used for centralized authentication across various platforms and devices.
- RADIUS servers manage authentication for routers, servers, VPN access, and 802.1X network access.

#### TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System)

- A remote authentication protocol developed for ARPANET access control.
- TACACS+ is the latest version, offering more authentication requests and response codes.

#### Kerberos

- A network authentication protocol allowing for mutual authentication and protection against on-path or replay attacks.
- It has been a standard since the 1980s and is used in various operating systems, including Microsoft Windows.

#### SSO with Kerberos

- Single Sign-On (SSO) with Kerberos allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple resources.
- It streamlines the login process but is limited to Kerberos-compatible systems.

#### Which Method to Use?

- The choice of authentication method depends on available resources and requirements.
- RADIUS is common for VPN concentrators, TACACS+ for Cisco devices, and Kerberos for Microsoft networks.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

- Multi-factor authentication involves multiple verification methods.
- It can range from expensive (hardware tokens) to inexpensive (smartphone applications).
