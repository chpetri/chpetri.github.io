#### Badge Reader

- Utilizes magnetic swipe, RFID, or NFC for identification.
- Applied in different contexts like time clocks, security patrols, and door access.

#### Video Surveillance

- CCTV systems often replace physical guards.
- Advanced features include object detection for identifying license plates or faces.
- Networked cameras recorded over time, with motion detection capabilities.

#### Alarm Systems

- Circuit-based systems for doors, windows, and fences.
- Motion detection for identifying movement without cameras.
- Duress alarms triggered manually in emergencies.

#### Door Locks

- Various types including conventional, deadbolt, electronic, token-based, and biometric.
- Multi-factor authentication might combine smart cards and PINs.

#### Equipment Locks

- Data center hardware often managed by different groups.

### 2.1 - Physical Security for Staff

#### Guards and Access Lists

- Security guards validate employee IDs and manage guest access.
- ID badges and access lists are essential for maintaining a secure environment.

#### Barricades / Bollards

- Designed to prevent unauthorized access and channel people through specific points.
- Safety measures include concrete barriers and moats.

#### Fences

- Creates a visible perimeter, with options for transparency and robustness.
- Includes anti-climbing features like razor wire or height.

#### Key Fobs

- Common for door locks with proximity operation.

#### Smart Cards

- Certificate-based authentication, often requiring additional factors.
- Integrated or external card readers for laptops and other devices.

#### Keys

- Used for doors without electronic locks or for standalone safes and cabinets.
- Key cabinets allow for formal management and auditing.

#### Biometrics

- Biometric authentication stores a mathematical representation, not the actual biometric.
- Specific applications include retina scanners, fingerprint scanners, and palmprint scanners.

#### Lighting

- Brighter areas are generally more secure.
- Specialized design considers light levels, angles, and facial recognition compatibility.

#### Magnetometers

- Passive scanning devices that detect metal objects.
- Not effective for non-metal items.

#### Mobile Device Management (MDM)

- Centralizes the management of both company-owned and personal mobile devices.
- Sets policies on apps, data, and device functionality.
- Manages access control, enforcing security measures like screen locks and PINs.
