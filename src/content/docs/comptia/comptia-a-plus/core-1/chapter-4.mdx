### 4.0 Virtualization and Cloud Computing

### 4.1 Cloud Characteristics

**Cloud computing**

- More then just a server hosted elsewhere
- Extend the management of applications and services
- Deploy an Infrastructure in Minutes
- Create and tear down as you need
- International Scope
- Deploy in different parts of the world.
- Using only the required Ressources
- Cost is based on the amount of use

**Common cloud models**

- Private cloud
  - Your own visual Data Center
- Public Cloud
  - Available over the internet to everyone
- Hybrid cloud
  - A mix of **Public** and **private**
- Community cloud
  - Several organisations share the same ressources
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
  - Sometimes called Hardware as a Service
- Outsource Equipment
  - Provider gives hardware, the rest is on you
  - For example Web Server Providers.
- Software as a service (SaaS)
  - No local Install
  - Central Management of data and apps
  - So Provider also gives Software, like google mail for example.
  - You dont do maintanance or anything. You log in and all is set.
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- No Servers, no software, no maintance team, no HVAC
- Provider does the platform, you doing the dev stuff
- You _DONT_ have direct control over the hardware, people, or infrastructure
- Basically your putting together the modules and the PaaS makes the rest.
- You choose the **available** Ressources to build your app on it, like Salesforce for example.

| Layer/Management   | On Premises | Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) | Platform as a Service (PaaS) | Software as a Service (SaaS) |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Application**    | Customer    | Customer                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **Data**           | Customer    | Customer                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **Runtime**        | Customer    | Customer                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **Middleware**     | Customer    | Customer                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **OS**             | Customer    | Customer                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **Virtualization** | Customer    | Provider                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **Servers**        | Customer    | Provider                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **Storage**        | Customer    | Provider                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |
| **Networking**     | Customer    | Provider                           | Provider                     | Provider                     |

**Cloud characteristics**

- _Shared resources_
- _Internal Cloud_
- No Ressource shared
- Build your own cloud
- Pay for everything upfront
- No ongoing cost
- _External Cloud_
- Share Ressources with a public cloud
- Infrastructure is provided by third-party
- May billed on usage or billed upfront

**Metered and non-metered**

- **Metered utilization**
- Pay what you use
- Cost to upload
- Cost to download
- Cost to stored
- **Unmeteret utilization**
- you pay for a Block of storage
- No cost to upload
- No cost to download

**Cloud computing Characteristics**

- **Rapid elasticity**
- Scale up and scale down as needed
- Seamless to everyone
- The cloud enables instant resources
- **High Availability**
- Systems are always available
- Redundancy provides Availability (If one Network, Server etc. dies, there is backup)
- **File synchronization**
- Informations, can be duplicated across the clouds.

**Desktop virtualization (VDI or DaaS)**

- Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) on premises
- Basic Application use
- Applications actually run on a remote Server
- You get a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure
- Local device is only mouse, Keyboard and screen
- Minimal Operating Systems on the client-side
- only minimal memory or cpu needed
- Network connectivity
- can consume lots of bandwith, due everything happens across the wired
- VDI in the cloud

### 4.2 Client-side Virtualization

---

**Purpose of Virtualisation**

- One computer, as many Os as you want
- mac, ubuntu, win11 all at the same time
- Seperate Os, indipendent CPU, memory, Network etc
- But all at one Computer
- Host-based virtualization
- your normal Desktop plus many others
- Been around since 1967
- IBM is inverter

**Legacy software and Operating systems**

- Need to run different application versions on the same system

– Run each application instance in a separate VM

- Application only runs on a previous OS version
- Create a VM with the older operating systems

**Cross-platform virtualization**

- Windows / macOS / Linux doesn’t do everything

– Each OS has strengths and weaknesses

- Run different operating systems at the same time

– Move between each OS seamlessly

– No rebooting

- Save time and resources

– One physical computer

**The Hypervisor**

- Virtual Machine Manager
- Manages the virtual plattform and guest operating Systems (virtualbox bspw)
- May require a CPU that supports, Virtualization
- Can Improve Performance
- Hardware management
- Vbox managing the use of cpu etc. for example

**Ressource requirements**

- CPU processor support
- Intel calls it VT
- Amd calls it AMD-V
- Memory (RAM)
- More then the requirements for the us
- Storage
- Can take up lots of Gigabyte
- Network
- Can Consume bandwith for Operating
- Config needs to be right (NAS, bridge etc)

**Sandboxing applications and operating systems**

- Isolated testing environment

– No connection to the real world or production system

– A technological safe space

- Virtualize development process

– Try some code, break some code, nobody gets hurt

- Additional development features

– Roll back to a previous snapshot

– Run additional systems

- Isolated testing environment

– No connection to the real world or production system

– A technological safe space

- Virtualize development process

– Try some code, break some code, nobody gets hurt

- Additional development features

– Roll back to a previous snapshot

– Run additional systems

**Pros of Building the Applications in a VM**

- Develop
- Secure Environmental conditions
- Kind of a "Safe space"
- Test
- A separate VE for testing
- Still in dev stage
- Drive tests to se if all works without ruin the App
- **Hypervisor Security Concerns**

- Hypervisor is a single point of failure and a sweet spot for attackers
- but there are no significant vulnerabilities till now
- Vm escaping!
- Never happened but possible
- Many hosted services are virtual environments
- So the potential vor Malware attacking all this vms OVER the Hypervisor is possible

\`

**Guest Operating System requirements**

- Every guest is self-contained - Like a real computer
- Use traditional security controls

– Host-based firewall, Anti-virus, anti-spyware

- Watch out for rogue virtual machines (VMs)

– The bad guys try to install their own system

– You’re in big trouble

- Self-contained VMs provided by 3rd parties can be dangerous

– You have no idea what’s running on there

**Network requirements**

- Most client-side virtual machine managers have their own virtual (internal) networks
- Shared network address

– The virtual machine shares the same IP address as the physical host

– Uses a private IP address internally

– Uses NAT to convert to the physical host IP

- Bridged network address

– The VM is a device on the physical network

- Private address

– The VM does not communicate outside of Virtual Network
