- Maintenance is usually prompted by the printer's page counter.
- Remember to power down before maintenance and be cautious as fuser units retain heat. Reset the page counter after maintenance.

**Laser Printer Calibration and Cleaning**

- Calibration adjusts the density of toner from different cartridges to ensure uniform printing quality.
- It can be an automatic or manual process depending on the printer model.
- Cleaning the printer is essential due to the accumulation of toner and paper dust. Use materials recommended by the manufacturer and avoid using harsh chemicals. The exterior can be wiped with a damp cloth, while the interior should be carefully cleaned to avoid dispersing toner particles.

### 3.7 - Inkjet Printers

**Inkjet Printer Characteristics**

- Inkjet printers are a popular choice for their affordability and high-resolution output.
- They operate quietly but can have high ongoing costs due to proprietary ink, which can also fade over time and is prone to clogging.

**Ink Cartridge**

- These printers work by placing tiny droplets of ink onto paper from cartridges.
- The standard color scheme for cartridges is CMYK: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (black).

**Print Head**

- Print heads may be built into the ink cartridge itself, meaning a new head comes with every cartridge change.
- Some models have separate ink cartridges and print heads.

**Feed Rollers and Duplexing**

- Feed rollers are crucial for moving paper through the printer and must be maintained to avoid wear.
- Duplexing, the ability to print on both sides of paper, is available in some inkjet models.

**Carriage and Belt**

- The ink cartridges are housed in a carriage, which may contain a print head, that moves across the paper.
- A belt drives the carriage motion, which is yet another component that moves within the printer.

### Inkjet Printer Calibration

- Proper calibration ensures that print nozzles are aligned with the paper, resulting in crisp lines and correctly aligned colors.
- Most printers have a built-in calibration function that might need user adjustments from time to time.

### 3.7 - Inkjet Printer Maintenance

**Cleaning Print Heads**

- The small nozzles on print heads can clog, a common issue with inkjet printers.
- Many printers run automatic cleaning cycles, but manual cleaning is also an option if print quality diminishes.
- Print heads and cartridges may be removed for manual cleaning if necessary.

**Replacing Inkjet Cartridges**

- Cartridges may contain individual colors or combine them.
- Replacing a cartridge is a quick process, but the printer may need a few minutes to calibrate the new cartridge.
- Empty cartridges are recyclable, made entirely of plastic.

**Inkjet Printer Calibration and Cleaning**

- Calibration aligns the print nozzles to ensure sharp lines and no color overlap.
- Printers usually come with calibration settings that can be adjusted by the user.

**Clearing Paper Jams**

- Given the complex paper path in inkjet printers, jams can occur.
- To clear a jam, remove any paper from the tray and the paper path with careful, firm pressure to avoid tearing.
- Ensure all scraps of paper are removed to prevent future jams.

### 3.7 - Thermal Printers

**Thermal Printer Characteristics**

- These printers use special paper that turns black when heated, eliminating the need for ink.
- They are very quiet, ideal for environments where noise is an issue.
- The paper used is sensitive to heat, light, and even adhesive substances like clear tape.

**Feed Assembly**

- The mechanism for pulling paper through a thermal printer is straightforward, involving a relatively simple paper path.

**Heating Element**

- A full-length heating element is used to heat the paper.
- Unlike other printers, there is no moving print head involved in thermal printing.

**Thermal Paper**

- The paper is chemically treated to change color with heat.
- Commonly seen in cash registers and credit card terminals, thermal paper resembles normal paper but feels slightly different to the touch.

### Maintenance for Thermal Printers

**Thermal Paper Replacement**

- Thermal paper is inexpensive but specific to thermal printers and comes in various sizes.
- The replacement process is user-friendly, typically involving a simple paper feed into a compact device.

**Cleaning the Heating Element**

- Isopropyl alcohol or specialized cleaning pens are used for cleaning.
- Gently swab the heating element, which is usually small, and consider using a cleaning card for the head and pathways.

**Removing Debris**

- Debris is minimal, usually just paper bits and dust since there's no toner.
- Blowing out the printer is recommended, done outdoors to avoid indoor dust dispersal.
- Wipe the printer with a damp cloth, avoiding vacuums unless they're specifically designed to be safe for electronic equipment.

### 3.7 - Impact Printers

### Understanding Impact Printers

**Dot-Matrix (Impact) Printers**

- A dot-matrix printer uses a print head with pins that press against a ribbon to mark the paper.
- These printers are effective for producing carbon copies and are cost-effective but noisy and not suited for high-quality graphics.
- Their use is now relatively specialized.

**Dot-Matrix Printer Head**

- The print head moves across the page, with pins striking the ribbon to create text and images.

**Printer Ribbon**

- The ribbon is a loop of fabric specific to the printer model.
- Replacement is simple and usually standardized across similar models.

**Tractor Feed**

- Paper is fed through the printer via holes on the sides, not friction.
- Continuous paper feed is used, often with perforations for easy separation.

### Maintenance for Impact Printers

**Printer Ribbon Replacement**

- The ribbon forms a loop and needs replacing when the print becomes faint.
- It's designed for easy replacement, often taking less than a minute.

**Print Head Replacement**

- The print head can withstand significant wear but may need replacing due to its direct contact with ribbon and paper.
- It's another modular component, typically easy to replace with a release mechanism.

**Replacing Paper**

- Paper replacement is more involved than with other printers, requiring precise alignment with the tractor feed.
- The positioning of forms is crucial for the print to align correctly with predefined spaces.
- Paper must be free of obstructions to feed correctly through the printer.

### 3.7 - 3D Printers

**3D printers Overview**

3D printers create three-dimensional objects by building up layers of material, following an electronic model. This method, known as additive manufacturing, eliminates the need for traditional machining. They are highly efficient for rapid prototyping, allowing for quick and cost-effective creation of designs that can be shared globally, and even used for projects in space.

**Filament 3D Printing**

- **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM):** This common method involves melting a plastic filament to construct an object layer by layer.
- **Practical Attributes:**
  - Suitable for general use with a larger printing area.
  - Filament is straightforward to handle.
  - Less messy, posing fewer issues with waste disposal compared to resin printers.

**Resin 3D Printing**

- **Stereolithography (SLA) 3D Printing:** Known for producing smooth, highly detailed prints through the use of a light source to harden liquid resin, layer by layer.
- **Handling Resin:**
  - Exercise caution and wear protective gear.
  - Dispose of unused resin at a hazardous materials facility.

**The Print Bed**

- **Significance:**
  - Acts as the starting point for 3D prints.
  - Must be level and clean to ensure proper adhesion.
- **Variants:**
  - Filament printers have a print surface directly on the bed.
  - Resin printers use the bed as a platform where UV light solidifies the resin.

By maintaining a clear distinction between the types of 3D printing and their specific maintenance needs, users can ensure optimal operation and longevity of their printers.
