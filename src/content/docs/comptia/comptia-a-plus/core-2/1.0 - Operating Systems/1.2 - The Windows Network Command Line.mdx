### 1.2 - The Windows Network Command Line

#### ipconfig

```powershell
ipconfig /all
```

- Essential for troubleshooting, starting with your IP address, like pinging your local router/gateway.
- It determines TCP/IP and network adapter information, along with additional IP details.
- View further configuration details, such as DNS servers, DHCP server, etc.

#### ping

```powershell
ping google.com
```

- Tests network reachability and determines round-trip time.
- Utilizes the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).
- A primary troubleshooting tool to check if you can ping the host.

#### netstat

    ```powershell
    netstat -a
    ```

- Provides network statistics applicable to many different operating systems.
- `netstat -a`: Shows all active connections.
- `netstat -b`: Displays binaries (specific to Windows).
- `netstat -n`: Avoids resolving names, showing numerical addresses instead.

#### nslookup

    ```powershell
    nslookup google.com
    ```

- Retrieves information from DNS servers, such as canonical names, IP addresses, cache timers, etc.
- Can look up both names and IP addresses, offering various options for detailed queries.

#### net

```powershell
net view
```

- A set of Windows network commands.
- Views network resources, like `net view <servername>` or `net view /workgroup:<workgroupname>`.
- Maps a network share to a drive letter with `net use h: <servername><sharename>`.
- Views user account information and resets passwords using `net user <username>` and `net user <username> * /domain`.

#### tracert

```powershell
tracert google.com
```

- Determines the route a packet takes to a destination, mapping the entire path.
- Utilizes ICMP Time to Live Exceeded messages, with TTL values indicating the hop count.
- Not all devices respond with ICMP Time Exceeded messages due to firewall filtering or low priority for ICMP traffic.

#### shutdown

```powershell
shutdown /s /t 60
```

- Shuts down a computer, with options to restart.
- `shutdown /s /t nn`: Waits nn seconds before shutting down.
- `shutdown /r /t nn`: Shuts down and restarts after nn seconds.
- `shutdown /a`: Aborts the shutdown countdown.

#### sfc (System File Checker)

```powershell
sfc /scannow
```

- Scans the integrity of all protected system files.
- Use `sfc /scannow` to initiate the scan.

#### Check Disk

```powershell
chkdsk
```

- `chkdsk /f`: Fixes logical file system errors on the disk.
- `chkdsk /r`: Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information, implying /f.
- If the volume is locked, chkdsk runs during startup.

#### DiskPart

    ```powershell
    diskpart
    ```

- Manages disk configurations.
- Launches with the command `diskpart`.

#### winver

    ```powershell
    winver
    ```

- Displays the About Windows dialog, useful for a quick version check and troubleshooting.
- Some operating systems, like Linux, Unix, and macOS, allow specifying the protocol for traceroute.
- iOS devices use UDP datagrams over port 33434 for traceroute, with adjustable port numbers via extended options.
- Different traceroute versions exist, with minor differences in transmitted payload.

#### pathping

        ```powershell
        pathping google.com
        ```

- Combines the functions of ping and traceroute.
- Included with Windows NT and later versions.
- The first phase runs a traceroute to build a network path map.
- The second phase measures round-trip time and packet loss at each hop.
