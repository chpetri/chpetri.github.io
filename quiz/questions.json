Rootkits achieve this by modifying the host's\noperating system or other software to hide their existence, allowing the attacker to maintain\ncontrol over the system without detection.\n* Definition and Purpose:\n* Rootkits are primarily used to gain and maintain root access (administrative privileges) on a\nsystem.\n* They disguise themselves as legitimate software or integrate deeply into the operating system to\navoid detection.\n* Mechanisms of Action:\n* Kernel Mode Rootkits: These operate at the kernel level, which is the core of the operating\nsystem, making them very powerful and hard to detect.\n* User Mode Rootkits: These run in the same space as user applications, intercepting and altering\nstandard system API calls to hide their presence.\n* Bootkits: These infect the Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Record (VBR) and load\nbefore the operating system, making them extremely difficult to detect and remove.\n* Detection and Prevention:\n* Detection Tools: Tools like RootkitRevealer, Chkrootkit, and rkhunter can help in identifying\nrootkits.\n* Prevention: Regular system updates, use of strong antivirus and anti-malware solutions, and\nintegrity checking tools like Tripwire can help in preventing rootkit infections.\n* Real-World Examples:\n* Sony BMG Rootkit: In 2005, Sony BMG included a rootkit in their digital rights management\n(DRM) software on music CDs. The rootkit hid files and processes, leading to a major scandal\nwhen it was discovered.\n* Stuxnet: This sophisticated worm included a rootkit component to hide its presence on infected\nsystems, making it one of the most infamous examples of rootkit use in a cyber attack.\n* References from Pentesting Literature:\n* In \"Penetration Testing - A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking\" by Georgia Weidman, rootkits are\ndiscussed in the context of post-exploitation, where maintaining access to the compromised\nsystem is crucial.\n* Various HTB write-ups, such as the analysis of complex attacks involving multiple stages of\nexploitation, often highlight the use of rootkits in maintaining persistent access.\nStep-by-Step ExplanationReferences:\n* Penetration Testing - A Hands-on Introduction to Hacking\n* HTB Official Writeups on sophisticated attacks",

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "SQL injection (SQLi) is a technique that allows attackers to manipulate SQL queries to execute\narbitrary commands on a database. It is one of the most common and effective methods for\naccessing sensitive data in internal applications that accept unexpected user inputs. Here's why\noption B is the most likely technique:\n* Arbitrary Command Execution: The question specifies that the internal application accepts\nunexpected user inputs leading to arbitrary command execution. SQL injection fits this description\nas it exploits vulnerabilities in the application's input handling to execute unintended SQL\ncommands on the database.\n* Data Access: SQL injection can be used to extract sensitive data from the database, modify or\ndelete records, and perform administrative operations on the database server. This makes it a\npowerful technique for accessing sensitive information.\n* Common Vulnerability: SQL injection is a well-known and frequently exploited vulnerability in\nweb applications, making it a likely technique that a penetration tester would use to exploit input\nhandling issues in an internal application.\nReferences from Pentest:\n* Luke HTB: This write-up demonstrates how SQL injection was used to exploit an internal\napplication and access sensitive data. It highlights the process of identifying and leveraging SQL\ninjection vulnerabilities to achieve data extraction.\n* Writeup HTB: Describes how SQL injection was utilized to gain access to user credentials and\nfurther exploit the application. This example aligns with the scenario of using SQL injection to\nexecute arbitrary commands and access sensitive data.\nConclusion:\nGiven the nature of the vulnerability described (accepting unexpected user inputs leading to\narbitrary command execution), SQL injection is the most appropriate and likely technique that the\npenetration tester would use to access sensitive data. This method directly targets the input\nhandling mechanism to manipulate SQL queries, making it the best choice.",
