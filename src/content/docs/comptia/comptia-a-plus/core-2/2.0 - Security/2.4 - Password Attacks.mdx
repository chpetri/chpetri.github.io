### 2.4 - Password Attacks and Other Security Threats

#### Password Attacks

- **ARP Poisoning (Spoofing)**: A technique where attackers send fake ARP messages over a network. This links the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network, diverting traffic to the attacker.

#### Insider Threats

- **Insider Threats**: Risks posed by individuals within an organization who might abuse their access to sensitive information. They might have a deep understanding of the organization's vulnerabilities and can direct attacks effectively.
- **Recruiting Insiders**: A tactic where external attackers might target employees to gain inside access, often in exchange for incentives like Bitcoin. This is especially prevalent in ransomware attacks.

#### SQL Injection

- **SQL Injection**: A code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications. Attackers manipulate standard SQL queries to access and manipulate databases.

#### Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

- **XSS Attacks**: Involve injecting malicious scripts into content from otherwise trusted websites.
- **Non-persistent (Reflected) XSS Attack**: The script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as part of the request.
- **Persistent (Stored) XSS Attack**: More damaging, where the injected script is stored on the target servers, such as in a database, and is then later transmitted to other users.

#### Security Vulnerabilities

- **Non-compliant Systems**: Systems that don't adhere to the standard operating environments, lacking updates, patches, or proper configurations, posing significant security risks.
- **Unpatched Systems**: Systems that haven't received the latest security updates are vulnerable to known exploits.
- **Unprotected Systems**: Systems with disabled or inadequate security measures, like antivirus or firewalls, are highly vulnerable to attacks.
- **End of Life (EOL) Products**: Products that have reached the end of their life cycle and no longer receive updates or support from the manufacturer, making them increasingly vulnerable over time.
- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**: Policies allowing employees to use their personal devices for work can introduce security risks, especially if these devices are compromised or poorly secured.

### Key Takeaways

- ARP spoofing is a significant threat to network security, leading to traffic diversion and potential data breaches.
- Insider threats are complex and can leverage institutional knowledge for targeted attacks.
- SQL Injection can manipulate databases, and XSS attacks can exploit user trust in websites.
- Non-compliance with security standards, failure to patch systems, and use of EOL products can leave systems vulnerable.
- BYOD policies introduce security risks that must be managed carefully.
